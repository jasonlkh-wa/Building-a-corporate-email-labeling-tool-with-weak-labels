CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS 
u u Friday, October 19, 2001 u u No. 640 u u 


[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 

[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's 
unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power 
Authority's requests 
for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. 
Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can 
meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. ""The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need."" 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. ""Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,"" said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. 
[18.1] Power Authority RFB Drafts Too 
Narrow to Grow Market, Say 
Respondents 
The Power Authority received a remarkably 
reserved response to its draft request for bids for mi-croturbines, 
fuel cells and photovoltaics, but most say 
the parameters it sets are too restrictive. The Power 
Authority planned to finalize the projects in its Octo-ber 
19 meeting. 
The microturbine maker Capstone is the only com-pany 
that can comply with the draft RFB in the short 
term, according to Jennifer Rice, Capstone vice presi-dent 
of governmental affairs. Others involved with the 
RFB also readily admit that Capstone, a known entity 
in Los Angeles Department of Water & Power terri-tory, 
is the only game in town. 
Sempra Energy, in its comments to the Power 
Authority, said that it had filed a response simply 
because it wanted to keep a placeholder to make sure 
that larger microturbines would not be excluded in 
future RFBs. Turbec, which has experience in the 
European market, also questioned the size restriction 
of microturbines in the RFB, noting that its standard 
unit is 100 KW. The RFB as written calls for 70 KW 
or smaller turbines. 
In the photovoltaics bid process, the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District said it was dismayed that 
the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing 
Authority was stepping on its territory and that the 
authority was limiting bids to a turnkey system, which 
SMUD maintains pads the cost. Green Mountain 
also wanted to expand the bid to consider existing in-stallations, 
central-station plants and power purchase 
contracts [J.A. S].

Dear Members of the Haas Community:

As I'm sure many of you have noticed, it was erroneously reported by email last Friday and in Haas Week today that Dean Tyson would continue serving as dean of the Haas School through the end of the academic year.  Professor Tyson will resign her position as dean at the end of December 2001 as she had planned.  Associate Dean Ben Hermalin will begin serving as interim dean of the Haas School on January 1, 2002, and will continue in that role until the Chancellor's choice of a new dean is announced.

The Dean's Office received an email from Vice Provost Jan de Vries announcing the formation of a search committee to select the new dean and a request that it be distributed to the Haas community.  The Provost's memo misstated the date of Dean Tyson's resignation.   Unfortunately, staff in the Dean's Office did not notice the error until after the news had been released.

The Dean's Office will forward a revised memo from Vice Provost de Vries regarding the Dean's Search Committee when it is received.

Yes, yes, but the CPA wants to build plants to fill that net short, so it's NOT good.

Subject: RE: Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA
Suspension Date


FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.
Best,
Jeff
CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Have you heard anything back on potential dates to meet.  I am in NY until
November 11th, so any date after that would be great!

Sorry you couldn't watch the movie last night - it was pretty funny.

Hope you are excited about the meat pie for dinner.  Won't that be a
treat???

Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful or not?  Two things occur to me.  First, it is not becoming for a commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of industry -- particularly if you're a Democrat.  Second, it has always struck me that what she needs is some form of record support, not political pats on the back in one-page letters.  I am asking you these questions not judging the proposal to send a letter .... but I've never understood what they're supposed to do for her and I honestly would like to understand.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Thank you for your explanation.  Often I think too literally and narrowly
and forget about the importance of spin.  All the same, I think we should
know if Loretta appreciates the open support of evil industry or not...I'd
say it's worth a call.

Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to
Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to
refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the
court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to
Angelides, instead.

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the
press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes,
etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own
energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of
massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the
public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end
direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just
not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario
Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.
Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter
would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Best,
Jeff

You aren't supposed to be hungry.  Dinner won't be served until 10pm.  Be
hungry at 10.

We leave for NY on the 1st and return on the 11th.  Staying at the Waldorf
the entire time.

Three dates.  OK.  Wait.  How about two dates?  November 15th (any time) or
November 22nd  (any time)??

I think the menus will be good also.  I think my mom has had their food and

SEARCH COMMITTEE FOR NEW DEAN ANNOUNCED; DEAN TYSON TO STEP DOWN IN DECEMBER 2001 

Vice Provost Jan de Vries has announced the members of the search committee for the new dean at the Haas School. A memorandum was distributed to the Haas community via e-mail on Friday afternoon. 


The memorandum included an incorrect date for Dean Tyson's departure from Haas. She will resign her position as dean at the end of December 2001 as she had planned. Ben Hermalin, associate dean for academic affairs, will be interim dean from January 1, 2002 until a new dean is in place. 


The committee responsible for conducting a search and making recommendations for the next dean of the Haas School has been named. The members are:


Barbara Horst Broque, assistant dean for planning, Haas School of Business 
Barry Eichengreen, professor , Department of Economics 
Hans Grande, MBA 02, MBA student and president of the Haas School MBA Association 
Robert D. Haas, BA 64, chairman, Levi Strauss & Co. 
Herma Hill Kay, professor, Boalt Hall School of Law 
David J. Vogel, the George Quist Professor of Business Ethics, Haas School 
James A. Wilcox, the Kruttschnitt Family Professor of Financial Institutions, Haas School 
Janet L. Yellen, the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration, Haas School


Professor Mark Lemley of the Boalt Hall School of Law will serve as chair of the committee. Another alumni member of the search committee is likely to be announced soon, according to officials. 


The committee will consult with the school community for both suggestions and views on candidates.  De Vries, who is vice provost for academic affairs and faculty welfare, formed the committee after consultation with various campus constituencies.

HAAS SCHOOL EVACUATION: PREPARING FOR NEXT TIME 

The Haas School was evacuated and the school was closed for classes and business last Wednesday afternoon after receiving a report of an unknown substance on several items of mail in an office in the faculty building. Both UC Police and a hazardous materials team were called in to conduct field tests and secure the scene. Officials reported that the substance was not hazardous. The event gave school officials a chance to witness the Haas emergency plan in action. 


""Overall the emergency plan was very effective, but there are some issues to be addressed,"" said Jay Stowsky, associate dean for school affairs and initiatives. ""We need to make sure that all of the faculty, staff, and students know what to do in case of an emergency.""


The Haas School administration has an official emergency plan. All faculty and staff are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the procedures outlined in building emergency plan. The full emergency plan can be downloaded at <http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/haas/emrginf2.html>. Haas Facilities Manager Edward Madera is working on a one-page emergency preparedness fact sheet for faculty, staff, and students to have on hand for reference. 


In the meantime, it is important to remember a few simple rules for evacuating the building: 

+ Stay calm, do not rush, and do not panic. 
+ Safely stop your work. 
+ Gather your personal belongings if it is safe to do so. (Take prescription medications, your home and car keys, and your wallet with you if at all possible; it may be hours before you are allowed back in the building.) 
+  If safe, close your office door and window, but do not lock them. 
+  Use the nearest safe stairs and proceed to the nearest exit. Do not use the elevator. 
+  Proceed to the designated Emergency Assembly Area (EAA): 
              +From the faculty building, evacuate to Gayley Plaza located directly in front of the Haas School. 
              +From the student services building, evacuate to the Boalt Hall parking lot. 
              +From Cheit Hall, evacuate west of Cheit Hall between Minor Hall (the optometry building) and the Women's Faculty Club. 
+  Wait for any instructions from emergency responders. 
+  Do not re-enter the building or work area until you have been instructed to do so by the emergency responders. 
+  If you are told to leave the area and later on want information on the status of the Haas School, visit the Haas web page at <http://haas.berkeley.edu/>.



For the latest instructions campus-wide emergency preparedness visit the UC Berkeley Office of Emergency Preparedness site at <http://public-safety.berkeley.edu/oepweb/>. This site also has information on mail handling procedures.

HAAS STUDENT TUTOR AT SKYLINE HIGH SCHOOL 

Lending a hand to high school students, even in a small way, can make a world of difference. The Haas School's outreach program Young Entrepreneurs at Haas (YEP) has done just this for years, and now the MBA students are adding to this outreach by tutoring at Skyline High School in Oakland. 


Every Monday (the class-free day of the week), Haas MBA students travel to Skyline High School to tutor students in math, English, and career planning as part of the MBA Education Club. The tutoring takes place during the Skyline lunch hours.  


The tutoring program started last year after J.P. Tennant, MBA 01 and former emergency relief teacher at Skyline, organized a small group of students to give some of their time to help Oakland students with academics.  This year the MBA Education Club has continued the tutoring program at Skyline and needs more volunteers. 


""If we get more support from Haas students we will expand the program to Berkeley High this year,"" said Doug Buzbee, MBA 02, the tutoring program coordinator. ""Without greater involvement from students though, we may have difficulty sustaining the current program at Skyline, let alone expanding into Berkeley.""


Skyline High School students, teachers, and administrators alike appreciate the tutoring provided by Haas MBA students.  Jim Delbridge, a 10th grade math teacher, provides his classroom during lunch hours so that students can get help from Haas volunteers.  The level of help needed is basic - reading, algebra, analytical geometry, and some calculus - but Skyline students benefit and genuinely appreciate the help.  


""Tutoring at Skyline is obviously rewarding unto itself,"" says MBA student Jon Metzler. ""But as a Haas student, it's also a way to keep connected with the local community, which I think lends perspective to what we do at Haas.""


If students are interested in becoming a Haas tutor, please contact Doug Buzbee at buzbee@haas.berkeley.edu.


In addition to the Education Club's tutoring initiative at Skyline, eight Young Entrepreneur Program mentors meet twice a month here at Haas with fifteen Skyline students. These Skyline students are part of the 84 students involved in the Haas-based Young Entrepreneurs Program this year.

GANESH IYER NAMED 2002-2003 SCHWABACHER FELLOW 

Ganesh Iyer, assistant professor in the marketing group, was selected as the Schwabacher Fellow for 2002-03. The fellowship is the highest honor that the Haas School bestows upon assistant professors. In addition to the honor, the fellowship offers a small cash prize, a research budget, and a reduction in teaching load. During his fellowship year, Iyer will continue his research in the areas of customer information markets, consumer identification and targeting, and Internet institutions and their market impact. 
  
""Ganesh was chosen by the Haas faculty executive committee because of the excellence of his research, the strength of his teaching, and his overall contributions to the school,"" said Ben Hermalin, associate dean for academic affairs. In addition, his paper, ""Markets for Product Modification Information,"" won the John D.C. Little Award for the best paper published in marketing science in 2000.


The Schwabacher Fellowship has traditionally been awarded to an assistant professor or pair of assistant professors to acknowledge their accomplishments in teaching and research. A committee made up of the academic group chairs and the assistant professors' representatives chooses the recipients.

DAN SULLIVAN AND PAT RIEGG RECOGNIZED WITH CHANCELLOR'S OUTSTANDING STAFF AWARD 

Two staff members who play important roles in the lives of Haas School MBA and undergraduate business students received one of the highest honors presented to staff, the Chancellor's Outstanding Staff Award. Dan Sullivan, director of student services in the MBA program, and Pat Riegg, career counselor for undergraduate business students in the Cal Career Center, were honored at a ceremony with the chancellor and vice chancellors on October 16, 2001.


""Dan truly cares about students and it shows in every thing that he does,"" said Dave Downes, director of the MBA program.  ""He will spend hours helping a student with a difficult problem, even though it means he will need to stay in the office long after 5:00 p.m. in order to get his own work finished.  He inspires his staff to do the same and he is an excellent coach and mentor for them.""


Riegg, who works out of the central campus career center, is the primary point of contact for Haas undergraduates in need of career services.  ""As a result of her 'can do' attitude, over the years, she earned the admiration and respect of students and employers,"" said Tom Devlin, director of the UC Berkeley Career Center. ""Essentially, she is the heart and soul of career services for the undergraduates at the Haas School. Pat is a strong advocate and practitioner of good customer service and it shows in the high esteem her customers -- students and employers -- have of her.""


Each year the Chancellor's Outstanding Staff Award (COSA) is given to staff members who have made exceptional contributions toward the university's mission of excellence in teaching, research, and public service. Nominations are accepted from staff, faculty, and students.

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change,
modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one
works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the
riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe
you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK,
of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the
event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other
stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

The SV Manufacturing Group intends to sign the ""business coalition"" letter 
making many of these points. The $8B is a number pulled out of thin air, 
right?

Have you given any thought to how we go about systematically restoring a 
de-regulated market....sans DWR and the State Power Authority....in 
California?

WOW what a week!!  I'm pretty sure these are the lowest scores ever - I'm
going to have my statistician check that out.

Meanwhile....EVERYBODY sat down - four different teams were picked and they
all lost so 12 of you will split the $120.00 pool!  (Almost as good as the
income tax rebate!)

It was really WAM's week - he not only married the lovely Shannon
McClennahan in Carmel this weekend, he also won first place for the first
time and he is a co-founder of the pool!  AND his beloved Cleveland finally
won when he bet on them!!

The week also brought good fortune to 2 first time winners for this year:

2nd place - Andy
3rd place - Mickey
and in 4th place was Cary

Congratulations to all of you!  Checks for Weeks 1-7 (actually six weeks)
will go out later this week so please let me know if you see any errors.


The scores were so low that there was not much movement in rankings to
report.

The pick sheet is attached for next week.

Saving Costs via Optics

With capital scarce and bandwidth aplenty, optical
components manufacturers face tough market conditions.
Now, systems companies are focusing on reducing costs
and helping carrier do more with the capacity they
already have. Happily, a number of optical technology
companies appear well positioned to capitalize on this
trend. At Optical Portfolio, you'll hear from startups
such as Symmorphix, Telephotonics and Proximion Fiber
Optics, which are using integration, tunability, and
real-time network monitoring to create more intelligent
and efficient optical networks.

A funny thing happened on the way to the market

The resources necessary to conduct clinical trials
require an enormous investment and small road bumps
in the drug approval process can kill a promising drug.
For many start-ups, one strike means you're out.  New
technologies and business models, however, promise to
dramatically change trial management.  This year's
Healthcare Outlook will look at the impact of clinical
trials on emerging companies as well as the investment
opportunities available in companies that look to change
the status quo. Healthcare Outlook's Private Equity
Platform has dedicated a special track that will feature
management presentations by early-stage companies looking
to improve the clinical trial process.  In addition, the
meeting will feature an industry roundtable, From the
Pipeline Through Clinical Trials, moderated by Sam
Collela, Managing Director of Versant Ventures.

STOCKS, YANKEES ON A TEAR

Much like the recent winning trend of the world champion New 
York Yankees, stocks were poised to add to recent gains at the 
open as earnings season continues in full swing amid the 
backdrop of an ongoing retaliatory campaign and bioterrorism 
scares.

Telecommunication equipment giant Lucent Technologies 
(LU,6.90,f2) said its loss for the fiscal 4Q widened to $0.27 
per share, excluding $8 billion in restructuring and one-time 
charges, worse than the $0.23 per share First Call consensus 
estimate. Including the charges, Lucent's loss widened to $2.59 
per share. The company cited the elimination of jobs and some of 
its product lines for the charges. Going forward, Lucent 
anticipates a sequential fall in revenue in fiscal 1Q before a 
rise in fiscal 2Q sales.

Leading U.S. oil company and Dow component Exxon Mobil 
(XOM,41,f2) posted 3Q earnings, excluding items, of $0.48 per 
share, below the First Call consensus of $0.50 per share on a 
9.5% revenue decline amid softening demand and weaker crude 
prices. In a similar story, oilfield services company 
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB,48,f2) reported 3Q earnings of $0.34 per 
share, $0.01 lower than the Street's mean forecast.

Pharmaceutical titan Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY,60,f2) posted 3Q 
earnings of $0.63 per share, in line with the First call 
consensus. Sales of the company's diabetes and blood-clotting 
drugs offset declining sales of its flagship cancer and anxiety 
medicines.

Insurance and financial services company MetLife (MET,26) 
reported that it was eliminating roughly 1,900 jobs in a move to 
cut costs amid weakening conditions in the sector. The Snoopy 
and Charlie Brown purveyor also reduced its claims estimates 
associated with the Sept. 11 attacks to roughly $210 million, 
down from the previous forecast of $250 million to $300 million. 
The company expects 3Q operating profits of $0.29-$0.31 per 
share.

Mobile-phone company AT&T Wireless (AWE,12.94,f2) said 3Q 
profits rose to $0.03 per share, well above the $0.02 per share 
loss expected by the Street. The company said that it added an 
additional 748,000 mobile customers during the quarter and sales 
rose 25%, but it plans to leave the fixed wireless business and 
take a related pretax 4Q charge.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were slightly lower as stocks were poised to open higher. 
Bonds will likely take direction from the equities market absent 
any significant economic data or Fed speak.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

Technology stocks once again led European bourses higher, with 
the Bloomberg European 500 Index up 1.99% as of 8:57 a.m. EDT. 
Dutch banking company ABN Amro (ABN,14.79,f2) lowered its fiscal 
year 2001 earnings guidance in the wake of the terrorist 
attacks, while drug giant GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK,55) saw its 
3Q earnings rise 20%, slightly above expectations. The dollar 
continued its upward trend against the euro as traders 
anticipate a quicker economic recovery in the U.S. than in other 
parts of the world. Adding to the gloomy economic landscape, 
Italian business confidence fell to 84 in September from 
August's 96, well below expectations. However, September's 
French consumer spending data was unexpectedly higher.

Asian markets were higher with Japan's Nikkei-225 finishing up 
2.80% led by strength in technology and exporters owing to 
continued weakness in the yen. The Japanese currency continued 
to slide against the dollar amid a government report that 
investors have sought better returns in foreign bonds since the 
beginning of the second half of the fiscal year. In earnings 
news, Chartered Semiconductor (CHRT,18.70,f1) reported a 
better-than-expected 3Q loss of $118.3.million and said it was 
close to a bottom in the beleaguered chip industry.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:57 a.m. EDT, the 
S&P 500 Index was up 4.5 points (7 points above fair value), 
while the Nasdaq 100 Index was up 15.5 points (17 points above 
fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was up 28 points 
(47 points above fair value) and the December crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were up $0.10 at $22.36/barrel.

It's 5 days before our Napa-Sonoma-Wine Trip.  I know all of you are anxiously waiting for this Saturday, but just forgot to actually sign up for the trip.  Seriously, the sign up has been slow due to midterms or other reasons.  We really need to know how many people can commit for the Napa-Sonoma trip, so please sign up by 3:00pm Wed, 10/24.
 
The wine trip will start off at Viansa with a Connoisseur Tasting and followed by a gourmet lunch in a reserved area of the Viansa hill top picnic grounds.  The Connoisseur Tasting includes food pairing and reserve wine tasting.  We will then move on to Gloria Ferrer for award-winning sparkling wines.  I have heard from several classmates raving about this winery.  It's a must see for those who have never been there!!  Finally, we will move on to St. Supery, situated in a historic landmark 1880 Victorian Atkinson House (now a living museum).  We will find exclusive St. Supery wines that can not be found anywhere else.  The trip is pre-negotiated at a group rate, one would have to pay much more to have the same type of experience.
 
Additionally, feel free to bring your spouse and significant others to enjoy one of your rare day-off from school and work.
 
Hope to see you all there!!
Tony

500 Index was virtually unchanged. Transport, retail and 
insurance stocks were among the best performers, while 
healthcare, phone and leisure issues were lower.

Shares of Lucent Technologies (LU,6.64,f2) were lower after the 
struggling telecommunication equipment giant said its loss for 
fiscal 4Q widened to $0.27 per share, excluding $8 billion in 
restructuring and one-time charges, worse than the $0.23 per 
share loss forecast by First Call. Including the charges, 
Lucent's loss widened to $2.59 per share. The company cited the 
elimination of jobs and some of its product lines for the 
charges. Going forward, Lucent anticipates a sequential fall in 
revenue in fiscal 1Q before a rise in fiscal 2Q sales.

Leading U.S. oil company and Dow component Exxon Mobil 
(XOM,41,f2) posted 3Q earnings, excluding items, of $0.48 per 
share, below the First Call consensus of $0.50 per share on a 
9.5% revenue decline amid softening demand and weaker oil and 
natural gas prices. In a similar story, oilfield services 
company Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB,49,f2) reported 3Q earnings of 
$0.34 per share, $0.01 lower than the Street's mean forecast.

Pharmaceutical titan Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY,60,f2) posted 3Q 
earnings of $0.63 per share, in line with the First call 
consensus. Sales of the company's diabetes and blood-clotting 
drugs offset declining sales of its flagship cancer and anxiety 
medicines.

Shares of MetLife (MET,27) were trading higher after the 
insurance and financial services company reported that it was 
eliminating roughly 1,900 jobs in a move to cut costs amid 
weakening conditions in the sector. The company also reduced its 
claims estimates associated with the Sept. 11 attacks to roughly 
$210 million from the previous forecast of $250 million-$300 
million. The company expects 3Q operating profits of $0.29-$0.31 
per share. In the days after the attack, analysts surveyed by 
First Call had dropped their 3Q EPS forecast to $0.14-$0.17 per 
share.

In the chip sector, shares of Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. 
(VTSS,10.36,f1) were higher after the CEO of the communications 
chip manufacturer said that he believes demand should improve in 
2002. Vitesse posted a fiscal pro forma 4Q loss of $0.14 per 
share, just below the lowered First Call consensus of a $0.13 
per share loss. Meanwhile, programmable chip maker Altera Corp. 
(ALTR,20,f1) posted 3Q earnings of $0.05 per share, in line with 
the Street's mean estimate, but indicated that sales will 
decline again in 4Q.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds reversed course to trade slightly higher as equities 
retreated from earlier highs. Bonds will likely take direction 
from stocks absent any significant economic data or salient 
Fed-speak. Increasing speculation that the government will be 
forced to issue a larger debt supply, such as tomorrow's 
scheduled $19 million two-year note sale, to subsidize the 
future fiscal stimulus may also be pressuring Treasuries.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets held on to early gains late in the day, with 
the Bloomberg European 500 Index up 2.57% as of 12:03 p.m. EDT 
amid mostly positive corporate earnings news. DaimlerChrysler AG 
(DCX,37,f2) posted a slimmer-than-expected 3Q loss on the heels 
of an aggressive cost-cutting campaign, while drug giant 
GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK,54) saw its 3Q earnings rise 20%, 
slightly above expectations. The dollar remained higher against 
the euro as traders weighed the relative lack of monetary 
stimulus in the euro-zone as compared to the U.S. Adding to the 
gloomy economic landscape, Italian business confidence fell to 
84 in September from August's 96 reading, the lowest level in 
more than five years and well below expectations.

Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

Dear Haas Evening MBA Students,

On Friday afternoon November 9, 2001, some of the School's most distinguished economists and I will participate in a ""teach-in"" about the US economy.  ""Economic Outlook Forum 2001"" will examine economic conditions in the United States in the wake of the tragic events of September 11 and the ongoing war on terrorism.  I am fortunate to co-chair this session with Professor Ben Hermalin, who will begin serving as Interim Dean of the Haas School in January 2002.  Professor Hermalin will moderate the panel presentations and following discussion.  In addition to myself, our economic commentators will be Professors Severin Borenstein, Jerry Engel, Rich Lyons, Ken Rosen, Hal Varian, and Janet Yellen.  An agenda for the program is attached.

I hope you may be able to join me for the Economic Outlook Forum in the School's Arthur Andersen Auditorium on Friday November 9, 2001 at 4:00pm. Tickets for the program will be available in your program office starting Tuesday evening October 23.  They will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. As you know, seating in the auditorium is limited.  If you are interested in participating in this discussion, I urge you to obtain a ticket as soon as possible.  Out of respect for your fellow students, please do not claim a ticket unless you are sure you will be able to use it.  There also will be a limited of standing room tickets available the day of the event.  I realize that many of you will not be able to take time away from your jobs to come to Berkeley for this event.  I am looking into the possibility of having a Web simulcast of the program in which you could participate.  I will keep you apprised about our progress in developing this feature.

I look forward to seeing you at the Economic Outlook Forum and responding to your comments and questions about the economy and about these exceptional national circumstances.


Sincerely,




Laura D'Andrea Tyson
Dean

Jack IS pretty juicy....but we shouldn't waste his precious fluids on Peevish Angelides.

I think sending it directly to Loretta makes more sense....she's the one with the regulatory portfolio over the issue...and Phil's tantrum doesn't deserve the price of stamp, much less a direct response.

In just two weeks, a roster of the brightest and most
seasoned technology investment, entrepreneurial and
management talent will be sharing their experiences,
war stories and perspectives on what it's going to
take to continue to build companies through 2002.
They'll share how they financed and structured companies
in past downturns to position them for success.  They'll
explain what the leadership focus should be, and
what sales and marketing strategies they adopted
to continue growing while the competition fell by
the wayside.

On November 6, at the Fairmont, San Jose, hear Bill
Campbell, the Chairman of Intuit, define the essence of
leadership in difficult times.  Matt L'Heureux, head of
worldwide technology M&A at Goldman Sachs will share
his expertise on what it takes to ensure your company
is a contender on next year's M&A prospect lists.
Ken Wilcox, President & CEO of Silicon Valley Bank,
will reflect on your current and future financing options.
And these are just a sample of the high-caliber speakers
participating at VentureWire's Executive Summit.  For
a full list of speakers and profiles, please link to:

http://events.venturewire.com/summit/default.asp

The collected  expertise comprehensively covers all
aspects of business management in turbulent times.
Time is running out and places are filling up quickly.
To be sure of your seat, please link to:

http://events.venturewire.com/summitEvent.asp

today to ensure you will be among the leading Valley
Entrepreneurs, CEOs and Investors attending.  I very
much hope you can join us.

Email Alert

Internet Daily 
for Tuesday, October 23, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Yahoo co-opts Explorer

Yahoo introduced Tuesday an application that makes changes to 
the settings of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and gives 
preference to Yahoo's email, search and other tools.

The free download program, Essentials, can make Yahoo's instant 
messaging tool the browser's default choice, as well as add 
links to Yahoo services in the Start menu of a PC running 
Windows. It can also make Yahoo's site the default home page for 
Explorer, and select the online service's email and search 
functions as the primary choice. Yahoo  is offering Essentials 
""in response to user demand,"" said Henry Sohn, vice president 
and general manager of network services.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
AOL, Yahoo, MSN to label sites' content

America Online, Microsoft Corp.'s  MSN and Yahoo have adopted a 
system to label Web sites to help parents prevent children from 
viewing objectionable content. Developed by non-profit trade 
group Internet Content Rating Association, the labeling is 
included in the Web pages' coding, which can be read by Web 
filtering software or browsers.

Content providers including Playboy.com  have also labeled their 
sites; the ICRA began a campaign Tuesday to encourage others to 
do so. ""Creating safer places for children to use the Internet 
has long been a part of the overall experience Yahoo provides, 
and working with the industry to develop the ICRA standard and 
labeling protocol is just the next step in our efforts,"" said 
Srinija Srinivasan, vice president and editor-in-chief.



-----------------------------------------------------------------
Net access in airplanes to be delayed

Adding Internet access to airlines' in-flight communications 
systems will take a little longer than expected. But it will 
happen nonetheless, according to a market analysis by Northern 
Sky Research. The Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting firm called 
the concept ""viable"" and predicted airline user fees for the 
service would total $804 million in 2005. ""Prior to the 
terrorist attacks, 12 airlines committed to equipping over 2,100 
of their aircraft with Internet service,"" said Karekin Jelalian, 
author of the report. ""The service has understandably fallen as 
a priority.""

-----------------------------------------------------------------
RealOne content providers listed

RealNetworks  said 20 media companies have signed up to provide 
audio and video content for RealOne, the company's subscription 
content service. They include CNet Networks, CNN, and the 
Weather Channel, as well as other content companies that also 
provide material to RealNetworks' current subscription service, 
GoldPass. The RealOne service, set to debut next month, uses new 
software that combines a Web browser and streaming media jukebox 
player.

Mike, Jeanne and Bob....the draft looks good...I have noted a few possible
changes and one question.  Let's discuss at your convenience.
 
With regard to interest, APSES asked for an audit.  Why don't we at least
ask for interest and use it at least as a trading point to get the
calculation after Jan. 18 pinned down.

The Indianapolis/Kansas City game is going to be played Thursday instead of
Sunday so I'm sending a revised Pick Sheet for Week #8.  Please try to get
your picks in as early as possible, but if you get your pick in for the
Thursday game before it starts we'll count it and wait for the rest of the
picks until Sunday.  Sorry we didn't catch the change earlier.

in the heart of Silicon Valley and my favorite place - the famous city of 
Palo Alto.  So, to continue this EvMBA tradition, you, your significant

drink some specialty beers at Palo Alto's Gordon Biersch located at:

640 Emerson St. (near Hamilton)
Palo Alto 94301

The gathering will take place this Friday, October 26th, at 6:00 and

	VentureWire Alert <http://alert.venturewire.com> 	 For Jeffrey Dasovich, Enron 	


VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	Is it 1999? If you looked at Tuesday's fundings you might think so as 25 companies pulled in almost $300 million. Cogent Communications, a high-speed ISP, raised $62 million in a Series C and also landed an additional $99 million credit facility. The majority of the company's previous investors participated in the equity round including Broadview Capital Partners, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Oak Investment Partners. 

It was also a big day for CENiX, a designer and manufacturer of high-speed optoelectronic interfaces, which raised $52 million in a combination of second round equity and debt financing. The company raised $34 in equity from previous investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Dongah Elecomm, and Cisco.

Another startup that came in with a big early-round was Avaki, which raised $10 million in the second tranche of its Series A, capping the round at $16 million. The developer of distributed computing technology for enterprises got first-round funding from Polaris Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Sofinnova. Post-money valuation was $25 million.

Meanwhile there was a strong showing in private equity as two firms closed over-subscribed funds. Berkshire Partners said it has closed Fund VI with $1.7 billion, about $450 million above its target. And the Riverside Company closed its third fund at $413 million, 65% ahead of its goal. The secret to their success? Both firms will concentrate on buyouts and other private equity deals and avoid venture capital investments. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Rethink, Rebuild, Rebound

This is the worst downturn ever to hit Silicon Valley,
but it's hardly the first. So VentureWire is convening
a summit conference of CEOs, COOs, CFOs, and others
who've lead venture-backed companies through such times
before. We've chosen them for their years of experience
and for their ability to share it as coaches, mentors,
board members, and friends. Join us for an intense day
of guidance an inspiration from those who've been
through boom and bust and boom again.

Healthcare Outlook: Biotechnology  Pharmaceuticals:
development, delivery and distribution

Tremendous competition exists to find the new technology
that will identify new drug targets. Bioinformatics
companies that can bring precision to the R&D process,
but yet, may never be profitable. An expensive and
pitfall ridden drug approval  process.  A complex
business landscape created by the mergers of giant,
multinational pharmaceutical companies and upstart
biotech ventures. In the span of one day Healthcare
Outlook will address these issues and look at the
business plans of 50 private companies that promise
to innovate an industry. Industry executives, leading
academics and venture capitalists will meet to lend
perspective and point out opportunities along the
complicated life cycle of developing a drug.

EARNINGS, EARNINGS, AND MORE EARNINGS

Amid a flurry of mixed earnings results and cautious guidance, 
equity index futures were pointing to a slightly positive open 
for stocks ahead of today's Beige Book economic summary at 2:00 
p.m. EDT.

Personal computer maker Compaq Computer (CPQ,9.40,f2&f4) said it 
incurred a 3Q loss, excluding items, of $0.07 per share, $0.01 
shy of the First Call consensus estimate, owing to sluggish 
demand, supply problems and competitive pressures. Looking 
ahead, Compaq lowered its 4Q outlook, saying its expects an 
operating loss of $0.03 per share, lower than the break-even 
First Call consensus estimate.

Long distance giant AT&T (T,17.70,f2), said 3Q profits, 
excluding costs and a $13.5 billion gain from parting with its 
wireless business, were $0.04 per share, in line with the First 
Call consensus estimate. Sales fell nearly 8% for the period on 
a slump in long-distance service demand.

Internet retailing giant Amazon.com (AMZN,9.55,f2) said its 3Q 
loss, excluding items, narrowed to $0.16 a share, matching the 
First Call consensus estimate, on revenues of $639.3 million, 
slightly below the Street's $650.3 million mean forecast. The 
company attributed the slimmer loss to cost cutting at its 
warehouses. Going forward, Amazon said it expects 4Q sales to be 
flat to 10% higher, down from its previous guidance of a 10%-20% 
increase. The new estimate would put sales in the range of $970 
million to $1.07 billion, below the First Call consensus of 
$1.10 billion.

Eastman Kodak (EK, 34), the largest photography company, 
reported 3Q operating profits of $0.52 per share, in line with 
the Street's estimates. The Dow component announced that it will 
eliminate as many as 4,000 workers, and that 4Q operating 
profits will be about one-third of the First Call consensus 
estimate of $0.46 cents per share, due to the economic malaise.

DuPont Co. (DD,42) posted 4Q profits of $0.13 per share, ahead 
of the Fist Call consensus estimate of $0.10 per share, but the 
chemical giant and Dow component warned that 4Q earnings would 
be roughly $0.12 per share, below the Street's mean $0.17 per 
share forecast, in anticipation of sluggish demand.

Aerospace and diversified manufacturer Honeywell International 
(HON,28,f2) reported 3Q profits, excluding charges, of $0.44 per 
share, matching the First Call consensus estimate. Including a 
$1 billion charge for job cuts and restructuring, Honeywell 
posted a net loss of $0.38 a share. The Dow component said its 
aerospace business was hurt by sluggish demand in the airline 
industry, aggravated by the September attacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were slightly higher ahead of today's 2:00 p.m. EDT Beige 
Book report on the economy, which will serve as a basis of 
discussion and policy at the upcoming Nov. 6 Federal Open Market 
Committee meeting. Additional monetary easing is likely given 
the backdrop of relatively subdued inflation and a weak economy.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European bourses were mixed with strength in paper, insurance 
and manufacturing stocks. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was 
down 0.05% as of 8:57 a.m. EDT. Economic data, reflecting waning 
inflation in Germany and France, fostered speculation that the 
European Central Bank will cut the benchmark lending rate at 
Thursday's meeting. The euro was marginally higher against the 
dollar following the news.

Asian markets were mixed with Japan's Nikkei-225 Index falling 
0.55%. Technology and pharmaceutical stocks were lower, while 
banking and communication stocks were among the best performers. 
Banks got a boost as the coalition party pushed to expand the 
authority of the Resolution and Collection Corporation to 
redress the bad loan situation. The dollar was slightly higher 
against the yen in early morning activity. Crude oil was trading 
lower following an American Petroleum Institute report that 
inventories rose a larger-than-expected 1.6% in the U.S.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:55 a.m. EDT, the 
S&P 500 Index was up 2.5 points (4 points above fair value), 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 1 point (5 points above fair 
value). The December DJIA futures contract was up 7 points (21 
points above fair value), and the December crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were down $0.31 at $21.54/barrel.

	Historically, I don't think it was an issue before Wheeler Ridge and
the increased flows at that receipt point.  Basically there is no minimum
Blythe flows set in the BCAP or by the Commission.  It is mainly an
operational issue for SoCalGas that they've somewhat managed without
getting into any Commission mandated procedure.  Actually, Florio raised the
issue as it impacts the core but the Commission never addressed it.
Typically, SoCalGas has managed the issue by having the core maintained
flows at Blythe.  As I recall there is some manner in which it is indirectly
addressed in the Comprehensive Settlement.

Greetings:
Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum
flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for
the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate
sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing
something, or don't have this right, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

MIXED PICTURE

Stocks drifted in and out of positive territory amid a plethora 
of mixed earnings results and mostly cautious guidance. Traders 
will likely look to today's Beige Book economic summary at 2:00 
p.m. EDT for more clues about the economic outlook.

As of 12:03 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 
0.2%, with the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.2% higher. The S&P 500 
Index was virtually flat. Computer-related, chip and drug stocks 
paced the advancers, while energy-related and telecom issues 
were among the worst performers.

Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN,7.65,f2) were sharply lower after the 
Internet retailing giant said its 3Q loss, excluding items, 
narrowed to $0.16 a share, matching the First Call consensus 
estimate, on revenues of $639.3 million, slightly below the 
Street's $650.3 million mean forecast. The company attributed

forward, Amazon said it expects year-over-year 4Q sales to be 
flat to 10% higher, down from its previous guidance of a 10% to 
20% increase. The new estimate would put sales in the range of  
$970 million to $1.07 billion, below the First Call consensus of 
$1.10 billion.

Shares of Compaq Computer (CPQ,9.41,f2&f4) were slightly lower 
after the PC maker said that it incurred a 3Q loss, excluding 
items, of $0.07 per share, $0.01 shy of the First Call consensus 
estimate, owing to sluggish demand and a fiercely competitive 
price war, as it continues to give up market share to rival Dell 
Computer (DELL,25,f1). Looking ahead, Compaq lowered its 4Q 
outlook, saying its expects an operating loss of $0.03 per 
share, lower than the Street's break-even mean forecast.

AMR Corp. (AMR,19.75), parent to airline carrier American 
Airlines and TWA, said its 3Q loss, excluding items, was $3.40 
per share, well below the First Call consensus of $2.61 per 
share. AMR blamed sluggish demand, exacerbated by the September 
attacks, for its troubles. Revenues for September alone fell 
22%. Looking forward, AMR's CEO said that 4Q results ""won't be 
pretty.""

Shares of Eastman Kodak (EK,29), were getting hammered after the 
photography giant reported 3Q operating profits of $0.52 per 
share, in line with the Street's mean estimate. The Dow 
component announced that it will eliminate as many as 4,000 
workers, and that 4Q operating profits will be about one-third 
of the First Call consensus estimate of $0.46 per share, due to 
the economic malaise.

Aerospace and diversified manufacturer Honeywell International 
(HON,28,f2) reported 3Q profits, excluding charges, of $0.44 per 
share, matching the First Call consensus estimate. Including a 
$1 billion charge for job cuts and restructuring, Honeywell 
posted a net loss of $0.38 a share. The Dow component said its 
aerospace business was hurt by sluggish demand in the airline 
industry, aggravated by the September attacks.

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds held on to gains in quiet trading ahead of today's 2-year 
note auction, the results of which will be released at 1:00 p.m. 
EDT. The Beige Book report on the economy, which will serve as a 
basis of discussion and policy at the upcoming Nov. 6 Federal 
Open Market Committee meeting, is scheduled for a 2:00 p.m. EDT 
release.

WORLD MARKETS

European markets were mostly higher late in the day with 
strength in paper, manufacturing and computer service issues, 
while energy stocks paced the decliners. The Bloomberg European 
500 Index was up 0.22% as of 12:03 p.m. EDT. BP PLC (BP,48) led 
the decline in oil stocks following reports from the American 
Petroleum Institute and Department of Energy that showed 
weakening U.S. demand for crude products. The DOE reported a 2.8 
million barrel inventory increase during the week ended Oct. 18. 
German Consumer Price Index data indicated that consumer prices 
declined 0.3% during the month through mid-October, and rose 
2.0% year-over-year through the same date, in line with the 
European Central Bank's inflation target, fueling optimism that 
the ECB will cut interest rates at Thursday's meeting in order 
to stimulate the weak euro-region economy. The euro, which rose 
against the dollar earlier following the data, held on to its 
gains.

So far, no members have sent me any of their comments on the filing.  It would be greatly appreciated should some of you do so before next week.  Thanks!

Subject: WPTF Principles for RTO Formation


Based on the amendments and comments made at yesterday's Board meeting, the following RTO principles are hereby adopted per yesterday's vote. 
  
  a.. The Western States should have a single RTO eventually, but initially there could be two entities (the California ISO and an RTO for the rest of the Region). FERC has a unique opportunity to mediate between RTO West and the newly formed WestConnect (the proposed successor agent for the now defunct Desert STAR) to form a single RTO for the non-California portion of the West. 
  b.. The RTO Governing Board should be truly independent, and be absent of any ""stakeholders"".  The Board should have at its disposal a meaningful stakeholder advisory committee for the purpose of airing technical issues, and identifying different viewpoints. The seats on the advisory committee should be equally split between load serving entities and suppliers 50/50. However, within each subgroup, there can be different representative classes as determined by the Board. 
  c.. The RTO should maintain separation of the operation of any energy market from the parties that own the transmission assets. 
  d.. The RTO should provide a real-time imbalance energy market, allow for self-provision of ancillary services, and operate a real-time market for each congestion zone within the RTO when transmission congestion is present. 
  e.. The RTO should provide demand response mechanisms in its Tariff, and the Tariff and Operating Procedures should either promote and enable retail competition, or not discourage retail competition. 
If you have any editorial comments or changes, please send them to me.  This is a working document. 
Dan Douglass will utilize this document to review the WestConnect filing, and in combination with members' comments on the same, prepare a briefing to the Board in a special teleconference Board Meeting that we will hold on Wednesday morning, October 31 (Halloween) at 11 a.m.

Hello everyone,

If you're in San Francisco this Friday, come join Enlai, Rolf, Gerry and 
myself at Kell's for a drink.  We plan to meet there at 6, and everyone is 
welcome!  I know it may be tough to choose between Kell's in the City and 
Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto, so just let your Friday afternoon location make 
the choice for you.

Kell's Irish Restaurant & Bar is located at 530 Jackson St.  The cross street 
is Columbus and their phone number if 415-955-1916.

Hope you can make it.

Streaming fee steams radio talkers

Two of the nation's highest-rated radio talk show hosts are not 
happy about their program syndicator's decision to begin 
charging for access to Webcasts of their programs.

Premiere Radio Networks, owned by Clear Channel Communications , 
is charging listeners $6.95 a month to hear the talkers' shows 
online. Overnight host Art Bell posted a note on his Web site 
(http://www.artbell.com/) saying, ""It was NOT my decision to 
change the free Internet access."" Dr. Laura Schlessinger, also 
reportedly unhappy, indicated on her site  that she was ""puzzled 
that some want to blame her ... because of this corporate 
cost-saving measure.""

Sports host Jim Rome's show is being offered by the service, 
StreamLink, as well. Premiere also syndicates Rush Limbaugh, who 
has his own pay-per-listen strategy of charging $39.95 a year.

Kraig Kitchin, president of Premiere, said in a New York Post 
report that it costs the company $1.5 million annually for 
streaming services. ""Time will show we have found a solution to 
allow that listening connection to continue, versus no longer 
(providing) the service,"" Kitchin told the newspaper.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
EarthLink to plug cable over DSL

EarthLink  has adopted what some might call a Trojan horse 
strategy. While striking a deal with AOL Time Warner  to have 
its Internet access service distributed on Time Warner-owned 
cable systems, EarthLink will encourage new customers to get its 
service through the competitor's cable service. Garry Betty, 
chief executive of Atlanta-based EarthLink, told analysts that 
profit margins are better with cable access service than they 
are by providing access through DSL. He also said EarthLink 
expects to offer broadband service to half the homes that 
receive Time Warner Cable by the end of this year.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Music streamer plans personal jukebox

RadioMOI.com will launch a personalized music jukebox service on 
the Web next January. Subscribers will be charged a monthly fee, 
yet to be determined, to be able to select tracks and listen to 
them on demand, and to save them as customized ""shows,"" 
according to the company's parent, Musicmusicmusic.com. On a 
related note, the firm announced a licensing agreement with 
Vivendi's Universal Music Group  for non-exclusive streaming 
rights to portions of the company's catalog, including 
recordings on the Chess, Verve and Motown labels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
MP3.com founder takes on Microsoft

Michael Robertson plans to release an operating system to 
compete with Microsoft's Windows next year. Based on the 
open-source Linux software code, the product, dubbed Lindows, 
will run both Linux and ""many popular Windows software titles,"" 
he said. Costing $100, the operating system is billed as 
enabling users to run it on as many PCs as they want. ""Once 
installed, LindowsOS offers a full-powered graphical desktop 
experience familiar to any computer user, but with advanced 
underlying architecture to ensure greater reliability,"" 
Robertson said, noting that an initial version of the software 
will be offered through the Web. Robertson previously founded 
digital music site MP3.com, acquired several months ago by 
Vivendi Universal.

Changing everyday habits doesn't come easily -- especially in making personal changes that conserve resources and protect the environment. Think lights on in an empty room. Think overpackaging of grocery products. Think leaky faucets that drain the nation's water resources drip by drip.

That's why the folks at the Center for a New American Dream (www.newdream.org) decided in July to take a different approach to encourage Americans to be environment-minded, responsible consumers. In launching its online program called ""Turn the Tide,"" the Takoma Park-based nonprofit group, dedicated to helping Americans change how they consume, was betting that results would speak for themselves.

The interactive volunteer program asks you to commit to taking nine simple actions in your daily lives over the next year. None of these ecologically smart adjustments is such a big deal. Each requires slight inconvenience but is easily achievable and produces a big payoff that is measurable.

The actions? As simple as taking steps to cut our junk mail by half or replacing the standard light bulbs in our houses with energy-efficient compact fluorescent units. One suggestion is to ""skip a car trip each week."" The reason: Automobile use is largely responsible for about a third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, says the center.

By measuring the effects of these ordinary actions, the CNAD activists are counting on convincing Americans of the value of making small changes. Each time a participant logs on to his personal ""Turn the Tide"" page to report his actions, the site's calculator instantly totals the quantity of resources saved as well as the total savings of everyone in the program.

Eric Brown, communications director at the Center for a New American Dream, says this is a ""powerful tool"" that helps remind everyone involved that we are not alone, and that small and simple everyday acts add up.

""We've signed up over 1,700 people so far,"" says Brown, adding that a bunch of organizations are going to begin promoting the program to their memberships, which should drive up these numbers soon.

The current participants, he says, ""will save over 5 million gallons of water, and prevent the release of over three-quarter million pounds of carbon dioxide over the course of a year,"" he says. ""By and large, our participants are really excited that they feel like they're making a difference.""

Recall



Last week, Wysco Inc. recalled about 95,000 Runt brand bicycles that, contrary to Consumer Product Safety Commission standards, were manufactured without any brakes. The $100 mini-bikes (about 24 inches long and 26 inches high with six-inch wheels) are red, blue, black or silver in color and display the word RUNT and a logo of a dog's face on the steering column. Bicycle, toy, discount, department, convenience and specialty stores nationwide, and mail-order catalogues and Web sites sold them from January through July. If you own one, call Wysco at 866-868-7868 for a free repair kit.

before. We've chosen them for their years of experience
and for their ability to share it as coaches, mentors,
board members, and friends. Join us for an intense day
of guidance an inspiration from those who've been
through boom and bust and boom again.

Healthcare Outlook: Biotechnology  Pharmaceuticals:
development, delivery and distribution

Tremendous competition exists to find the new technology
that will identify new drug targets. Bioinformatics
companies that can bring precision to the R&D process,
but yet, may never be profitable. An expensive and
pitfall ridden drug approval  process.  A complex
business landscape created by the mergers of giant,
multinational pharmaceutical companies and upstart
biotech ventures. In the span of one day Healthcare
Outlook will address these issues and look at the
business plans of 50 private companies that promise
to innovate an industry. Industry executives, leading
academics and venture capitalists will meet to lend
perspective and point out opportunities along the
complicated life cycle of developing a drug.

* Optical Processor Firm Chorum Lands $54.7M Round Four
By Giselle Greenwood <mailto:greenwood@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=NIQLONQMII> 	
RICHARDSON, TEXAS -- Chorum Technologies, a provider of all-optical processors and subsystems for optical networks, said it raised $54.7 million in its fourth round of funding. 

Lead investors in the round included previous investors CenterPoint Ventures, InterWest Partners, Sevin Rosen Funds, and Scudder-Kemper Investments. Other investors included new investor Wheatley Partners, and previous investors Star Ventures, Austin Ventures, Rho Management Trust, Crown Advisors International, Azure Capital Partners, Sycamore Ventures, Bowman Capital Management, and J. & W. Seligman. The round, a down round, was completed in September.

No new board members were added to the seven member board. The company is in negotiations about filling open seats as well as the possibility of raising a fifth round targeting $10 million.

The company will use the funds to develop its existing products and begin producing new products. The company said the funding, combined with existing capital, will last more than two years.

* Encorp Closes $38.1 Million Series D, Names New CEO
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=QLPMJQPMII> 	
WINDSOR, COLO. -- Encorp, a provider of products and services for the power-technology sector, has closed $38.1 million in Series D financing and appointed Dennis Orwig as chief executive officer. 

New investor Ballentine Capital Partners led the round, which also included other new investors, Perseus and Wexford Management. All existing investors -- Arete's Utech Climate Challenge Fund, Craig Drill Capital, Enron North America, Enstar Management, and Micro-Generation Technology Fund -- reinvested. Banc of America Securities served as placement agent for the deal.

Encorp had expected to raise $20 million for the round when it began fund-raising last fall, said Mr. Orwig, adding that the company's valuation is significantly up from the last round. Prior to this round, the company had raised $4.5 million. 

Prior to Encorp, Mr. Orwig served as CEO and president of Catalytica Energy Systems, a manufacturer of pollution-prevention equipment. He replaces founder and former CEO and president, Jeff Whitham, who retains his chairman position on the board. The president position remains open.

Steve Ballentine of Ballentine Capital Partners joins the board, as does Mr. Orwig. Seven directors comprise the board, which is full.

New funds will be used for product and service development and commercialization. The company employs 115 and does not expect significant staff growth in the next year. Encorp, which opened six new sales offices this year, doesn't plan any additional new offices. 

The company will break even within the next five years, said Mr. Orwig, who added that the company will be investing heavily in product development in the next 15 months. Encorp expects to generate $10 million to $12 million in revenues this year.

* Napster Cuts 15% of Staff, Prepares for New Service
By Lizbeth Scordo <mailto:scordo@technologicp.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=NIIHKIQMII> 	
REDWOOD CITY, CALIF. -- Napster, the embattled online song-swapping service, has cut 16 employees, approximately 15% of its staff, in an effort to strengthen resources in other areas as it prepares for the launch of its new membership-based service, the company said in a written statement. 

A Napster spokesperson said the layoffs mainly focused on customer service, business development departments, and administration areas. The company's staff now totals 88.

Last month Napster said it reached a preliminary agreement with American songwriters and music publishers to settle their class-action lawsuit, under which Napster agreed to pay damages of $26 million to music creators and copyright owners for unauthorized uses of music, and will also pay an advance of $10 million against future licensing royalties. The company has also settled lawsuits brought by musicians Metallica and Dr. Dre. 

Napster, which once let users download and trade songs for free, is planning to launch a fee-based membership service, though the target date has not been disclosed. 

The company is backed by Hummer Winblad, the University of California at Los Angeles, and individuals. Last year Napster also received a $60-million loan from Bertelsmann that may convert to equity.

* Bigstep Lays Off A Third of Staff
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IJMKMNPMII> 	
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bigstep, which provides small businesses with electronic business services, has laid off 25 employees, according to CEO Lucy Reid.

Since last December, the company's staff size has shrunk from 150 employees to 50. This round of layoffs eliminated positions in engineering, content, marketing, and administration, including two vice presidents. The layoffs came after Bigstep attracted fewer customers as it became a fee-based service this summer and also from the completion of Bigstep's product development, said Ms. Reid. 

The company, which has raised $72 million in venture capital, closed $6.5 million in Series E funding in September from InterWest Partners, Mayfield, Partech International, Staenberg Venture Partners, U.S. Venture Partners, VeriSign, The Washington Post, and Worldview Technology Partners. 

Ms. Reid said the layoffs were not related to the funding and that the company still expects to break even in the third quarter of 2002.

* Tropic Networks Releases 19% of Staff to Save Cash
By Jeffrey Sanders <mailto:sanders@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=MJHKLOQMII> 	
OTTAWA -- Tropic Networks, which develops optical packet networking systems, released 35 people, or 19% of its total staff in an across-the-board cost-cutting move, according to a company spokesperson.

The layoffs occurred in both of Tropic's offices, in Ottawa and Andover, Mass., with the most cuts in the Ottawa office. The company, which now employs 150, did not make any changes to its executive management team, the spokesperson said. All employees received severance packages.

In early September, Tropic Networks secured a $10 million loan from GATX/MM Venture Finance Partnership, Silicon Valley Bank, and Transamerica Commercial Finance. The money was to be used for purchasing equipment for product trials and testing.

The company reduced its headcount in order to preserve its cash until 2003, the spokesperson said, adding that it is still on target to release its first product in 2002. 

Tropic Networks has raised $80 million to date and is also backed by Altamira Management, Anschutz Investment Co., Celtic House, Crescendo Ventures, Enron Broadband Services, Goldman Sachs Group, Kodiak Venture Partners, the Ontario Teachers Pension, and Raza Foundries.

* RadioWave.com in Talks to be Acquired, May Lay Off 25
By Giselle Greenwood <mailto:greenwood@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IPNQPOPMII> 	
CHICAGO -- RadioWave.com, which provides a Web-based, interactive audio player, has warned 25 of its 28 employees of possible layoffs with severance in two weeks.

CEO Bill Pearson said the company is in a ""pretty vulnerable state,"" and is talking to several companies about the possibility of being acquired. Although the company has not shut down, if no one acquires the company, it will no longer be in business, Mr. Pearson said, adding that he expects a decision to be made in two weeks. 

""It is a possibility that we will remain intact,"" Mr. Pearson said. ""However, we're anticipating the worst.""

Mr. Pearson attributed the slumping ad market to the company's demise, leading to the decision to increase its fees to make up for revenue loss. Previously, the company did not rely on its fees as a source of revenue, but with ad revenue flagging, Mr. Pearson said a fee increase is necessary.

If the company is acquired, Mr. Pearson said it will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of a larger company.

RadioWave.com has raised $22 million from FBR Technology Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Motorola, Susquehanna Radio, and Warburg, Pincus Equity Partners.

* FreeRein Lays Off Most of Staff, Looks for Buyers and Funds
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=MJHJNHQMII> 	
BELLEVUE, WASH. -- FreeRein, a developer of platforms that provide enterprise applications and services, has laid off all but six of its 31 remaining employees, according to CEO Bruce Gilpin.

The company laid off five employees in September, but needed to make additional cuts to conserve cash, Mr. Gilpin said. Of the firm's executive staff, Mr. Gilpin, the chief financial officer, the chief scientist, and the vice president of product strategy remain.

FreeRein continues to operate and to fund-raise for $10 million in Series B financing, though it has also begun to look for a buyer. Existing investors ComVentures and Technology Partners will contribute to the round if FreeRein can secure a new lead investor, said Mr. Gilpin. He added that given the current fund-raising environment, an acquisition is more likely. FreeRein expects to find a buyer in the wireless enterprise or carrier sectors.

Without additional capital, the company can operate through the end of the year, since 90% of its former staff worked on technology development. The company expects to generate $500,000 in revenues this year.

FreeRein has raised $15 million in venture capital from ComVentures and Technology Partners. In March, FreeRein acquired Clarios, which creates wireless platforms for messaging, in a stock swap.

* E-mail Management Software Firm Postini Buys Neomeo
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=NMIKIKPMII> 	
REDWOOD CITY, CALIF. -- Postini, a provider of e-mail management software and services, said it has acquired San Francisco-based Neomeo, an enterprise software company that develops corporate e-mail services. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Fewer than 10 Neomeo employees will join Postini, including CEO Amir Bakhtiar. Neomeo had developed its product but did not have a full sales team, nor was it generating significant revenues, said Scott Petry, founder and vice president of products at Postini. The companies were introduced to each other through a mutual industry contact. Neomeo raised about $5 million in venture capital from Softbank and individual investors. 

Including former Neomeo employees, Postini has a staff of more than 30. Postini will offer at least some of Neomeo's products, said Mr. Petry. 

Baker and McKenzie advised Postini, while Cooley Godward advised Neomeo.

Postini is backed by $17 million from August Capital, Sumit Accelerator, Sun Microsystems, and individuals.

TYSONS CORNER, VA. -- Paras Ventures, a management and investment firm, announced its launch.

The company is being headed by Rahul Bhandari, formerly vice president of business development and alliances and co-founder of Accenture's business launch center. The company's investment focus will be in enterprise software, security, biotech, and related emerging technology. 

Aside from providing funding, the company will provide services to other venture capital firms' portfolio companies, and help oversea companies establish U.S. operations.

VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	It wasn't as big a day funding wise compared to yesterday's $300 million windfall, but eight companies still managed to pull in a respectable $186 million. The big fundings went to three companies, all in the fourth round. Chorum Technologies, a provider of all-optical processors and subsystems for optical networks, raised $54.7 million in its fourth round of funding led by previous investors CenterPoint Ventures, InterWest Partners, Sevin Rosen Funds, and Scudder-Kemper Investments. 

Four was also a lucky number for Encorp, a provider of products and services for the power-technology sector, that closed $38.1 million in Series D financing led by new investor Ballentine Capital Partners. Meanwhile 2Wire, a developer of products that provide broadband content and services throughout the home, announced that it closed its fourth round of funding at $61 million that VentureWire first reported in August. 

Napster is also back in the news as it tries to change its tune. The embattled online song-swapping service, cut 16 employees, approximately 15% of its staff, in an effort to strengthen resources in other areas as it prepares for the launch of its new membership-based service. The layoffs mainly affected the customer service, business development departments, and administration areas and leave the company with a staff of 88. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Healthcare Outlook: Biotechnology  Pharmaceuticals:
development, delivery and distribution

Tremendous competition exists to find the new technology
that will identify new drug targets. Bioinformatics
companies that can bring precision to the R&D process,
but yet, may never be profitable. An expensive and
pitfall ridden drug approval  process.  A complex
business landscape created by the mergers of giant,
multinational pharmaceutical companies and upstart
biotech ventures. In the span of one day Healthcare
Outlook will address these issues and look at the
business plans of 50 private companies that promise
to innovate an industry. Industry executives, leading
academics and venture capitalists will meet to lend
perspective and point out opportunities along the
complicated life cycle of developing a drug.

ECONOMIC DATA DAMPEN OUTLOOK AT OPEN

Equity index futures fell and bonds rose following this 
morning's release of a flurry of economic data. While most of 
the data was generally in line with expectations, durable goods 
orders dropped sharply, lending further support to the notion of 
a contraction in 3Q.

Against the backdrop of the tame inflation and steady jobless 
picture reflected in this morning's data, durable goods orders 
for the month of September plunged, owing to weakness in 
transportation orders, particularly aircraft. The 8.5% drop in 
durable good orders was much worse than forecast.

In equities news, Electronic Data Systems (EDS,62,f2) posted 3Q 
earnings, excluding items, of $0.69 per share, $0.01 ahead of 
the Street's mean estimate. The CFO said he expects the computer 
systems consultant to continue to grow earnings in the 
double-digit range, and the company remains comfortable with the 
Street's 4Q consensus earnings forecast of $0.78 per share.

Long-distance and data services company WorldCom Group 
(WCOM,12.45,f1) reported a 41% decline in 3Q profits to $0.16 
per share, matching the First Call consensus forecast. Revenues 
rose 12%, boosted by growth in the company's data and Internet 
services segments. The company's CEO said he expects WorldCom's 
growth segments to gain market share, despite the current 
economic malaise.

Dow Chemical Co. (DOW,35,f2), the largest U.S. chemical maker, 
reported a 3Q profit, excluding restructuring costs, of $0.16 
per share, in line with the Street's mean estimate. Dow said it 
sees 4Q profits of $0.10-$0.20 per share, compared to the 
Street's consensus of $0.17 per share.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds rose across the curve following the release of a slew of 
economic data this morning. Durable goods orders for September 
fell 8.5% according to the Commerce Department, much worse than 
the expected 1.3% decline per Dow Jones Newswires, suggestive of 
a potential 3Q economic contraction. Excluding transportation, 
orders fell 5.5% as aircraft orders plummeted 29%. Orders for 
communications equipment and electronic products fell, while 
semiconductor and defense capital goods orders rose.

Initial jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 504,000 for the week 
ended Oct. 20, according to the Labor Department. Analysts per 
Dow Jones Newswires were looking for an increase to 500,000. The 
four-week moving average of claims rose to 505,000, a 10-year 
high, and continuing claims for the week ended Oct. 13 increased 
to 3,654,000, an 18-year high.

The 3Q employment cost index rose 1.0%, slightly above the Dow 
Jones Newswires forecast of a 0.9% increase. Most of the 
increase was attributed to a 1.6% rise in benefits costs for the 
quarter, while wages and salaries rose 0.8% versus 2Q's 1.0% 
rise. The government said the data was not distorted by the 
Sept. 11 attacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets were under pressure following the European 
Central Bank's decision to leave the benchmark lending rate 
unchanged at 3.75%. Pharmaceutical, telecom and auto stocks 
contributed to the declines in European markets, with the 
Bloomberg European 500 Index down 1.86% as of 8:55 a.m. EDT. The 
euro fell against the U.S. dollar in the absence of a rate cut 
but recouped all of those losses following the bleak U.S. 
economic data.

Asian markets closed higher with Japan's Nikkei-225 Index up 
0.72%, paced by strength in banking and drug stocks. In equities 
news, Sony Corp. (SNE,41) reported a first-half operating loss 
in line with expectations due to weakness in its core 
electronics division. The dollar was down against the yen 
following this morning's dismal U.S. economic data, despite 
earlier comments by financial diplomat Haruhiko Kuroda, which 
intimated more FOREX intervention to weaken the Japanese 
currency as necessary.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:55 a.m. EDT, the 
S&P 500 Index was down 10 points (11 points below fair value), 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 28 points (35 points below 
fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was down 85 
points (99 points below fair value), and the December crude oil 
futures traded on the NYMEX were down $0.11 at $22.22/barrel.

Circuit Breaker: Enron Dumps CFO Amid Conflict Questions

By Stephen Taub

Enron Corp. is set to replace CFO Andrew Fastow. As CFO.com reported in a
story earlier this week, Fastow's role in a limited partnership has raised
concerns about a conflict of interest. 

Fastow is succeeded by Jeff McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and
CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was
Enron's treasurer. He resigned that post in part because he disapproved of
Fastow's role in running two partnerships, according to The Wall Street
Journal. 

""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as
CFO,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO, in a statement. 

McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office
as CFO for the company's European operations. Upon returning to the United
States, McMahon assumed the post of EVP of finance and treasurer for Enron
Corp. In 2000, he was named president and COO of Enron Net Works, where he
focused on E-commerce activities. 

As reported on Friday, The Wall Street Journal said a limited partnership
organized by Fastow, who has been Enron's CFO since 1997, racked up millions
of dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company. 

On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

On October 16, Enron stunned Wall Street when it announced that it would
take a $1.01 billion after-tax charge for the September 30 quarter. 

Since the announcement, Enron's share price has more than halved. 

Fastow's dismissal seems to be an about-face for Enron. In a conference call
Tuesday, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to
assure that there was no conflict as Fastow played both roles. Enron has
since dissolved the partnerships. 

""Obviously, the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there
would be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed
certain methods for it to be dealt with ... so Enron would never be
compromised,"" Lay said in published accounts. ""We are very concerned [at]
the way Andy's character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles,
as well as the company's reputation."" 

Predictably, on Wednesday at least two law firms - Stull, Stull & Brody and
Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, L.L.P - filed class-action suits against
Enron, Lay, Fastow, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief
executive who resigned in August. 

The suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information
that materially misstated the company's condition and prospects to the
investing public. Moreover, the suits argue that the company failed to
disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not
misleading. 

The complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning
its business, financial results, and operations which failed to disclose,
among other things: 

* The company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining
demand for bandwidth, and the company's efforts to create a trading market
for bandwidth were not meeting with success, as many of the market
participants were not creditworthy. 

* The company's operating results were materially overstated, since Enron
failed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with
certain limited partnerships - the partnerships that were managed by Fastow.


* Enron was failing to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in
accordance with GAAP.

STOCKS SUFFER MORE ECONOMIC BLUES

Stocks slid at the open and remained firmly in negative 
territory following this morning's mostly ominous economic 
releases, as the fallout from the September attacks continues. 
Durable goods orders dropped sharply, lending further support to 
the notion of a contraction in 3Q, while first-time jobless 
claims hit their highest level in almost a decade. Existing home 
sales also weakened as prospective buyers put large purchases on 
hold.

As of 11:54 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 
1.3%, with the Nasdaq Composite Index lower by 2%. The S&P 500 
Index was down 1.3%. Retailing, software, semiconductor and 
communication stocks paced the decliners, while oil-related, 
healthcare and transport issues were widely higher.

Shares of American International Group (AIG,81) were lower after 
the company posted an 81% decline in 3Q earnings as a result of 
the terrorist attacks, its acquisition of American General Corp. 
and debt write-offs. Excluding the charges, but including the 
$820 million in World Trade Center claims, the insurance giant 
posted operating earnings of $0.55 per share, ahead of the First 
Call consensus estimate of $0.54 per share.

Shares of Electronic Data Systems (EDS,64,f2) were higher after 
the computer systems consulting company posted 3Q earnings, 
excluding items, of $0.69 per share, $0.01 ahead of the Street's 
mean estimate. CFO James Daley said he expects the company to 
continue to grow earnings in the double-digit range, and EDS 
remains comfortable with the Street's 4Q consensus earnings 
forecast of $0.78 per share.

Long distance and data services company WorldCom Group 
(WCOM,12.32,f1) reported a 41% decline in 3Q profits to $0.16 
per share, matching the First Call consensus forecast. Revenues 
rose 12%, boosted by growth in the company's data and Internet 
services segments, and the company's CEO, Bernard Ebbers, said 
he expects WorldCom's growth segments to gain market share, 
despite the current economic malaise.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds held on to gains at midday following the release of 
largely pessimistic economic data this morning. Durable goods 
orders for September fell 8.5%, according to the Commerce 
Department, much worse than the expected 1.3% decline per Dow 
Jones Newswires, suggestive of a potential 3Q economic 
contraction. Excluding transportation, orders fell 5.5% as 
aircraft orders plummeted 29%. Excluding defense, orders fell 
9.1%, while defense capital goods orders rose 4.6%.

Initial jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 504,000 for the week 
ended Oct. 20, according to the Labor Department, the first time 
above the 500,000 level since 1992. Analysts were looking for an 
increase to 500,000. The four-week moving average of claims rose 
to 505,000, a 10-year high, and continuing claims for the week 
ended Oct. 13 increased to 3,654,000, an 18-year high.

The 3Q employment cost index rose 1.0%, slightly above the Dow 
Jones Newswires forecast of a 0.9% increase. Year over year, the 
increase was 4.1% through September, above the 3.9% 
year-over-year reading through June. Most of the increase was 
attributed to a 1.6% rise in benefits costs for the quarter, 
while wages and salaries rose 0.8% versus 2Q's 1.0% rise. The 
government said the data was not distorted by the Sept. 11 
attacks.

Existing home sales plunged in September, down 11.7% to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million units, less than 
the Bloomberg consensus forecast of a decline to a 5.20 million 
rate. The drop was the largest since 1995 as consumers pulled 
back following the attacks. According to the National 
Association of Realtors, the inventory of unsold homes rose to a 
5.4-month supply from August's 4.8 reading.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

Technology stocks led European bourses lower late in the session 
following the dismal economic data in the U.S. and the European 
Central Bank's decision to leave the benchmark lending rate 
unchanged at 3.75%. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was down 
2.04% as of 11:54 a.m. EDT. European Central Bank President Wim 
Duisenberg said, ""If there were to be a further improvement in 
inflation prospects, then that would provide for further room to 
maneuver on monetary policy."" The euro was virtually flat 
against the U.S. dollar in choppy trading following this 
morning's uninspiring economic situation.

Commissioner Wood is not letting go of the retroactive direct access suspension issue.  Attached for your information is a ruling issued Tuesday which calls for parties to file comments by November 2 (and reply comments on November 8) on the following questions:
  _____  


It is noted that statistics from the utilities' monthly filings (see attached Appendix A)[1] show that commencing on or about July 1, 2001, there has been an increase in customers switching to direct access.  This information further highlights the concerns about cost-shifting and the need to minimize the significant impacts to bundled electric customers who will likely be left with more costs.[2]  These cost-shifting issues are part of the Commission's consideration in determining whether there should be an earlier suspension date and what this date should be.

Accordingly, in this Assigned Commissioner's Ruling, the following issues are presented for comment by interested parties:

1.      Why should or shouldn't the Commission choose an earlier date (than after September 20, 2001) for suspending the right to acquire direct access service?

2.      If the Commission should choose an earlier date, why should or shouldn't the Commission consider the July 1, 2001 suspension as set forth in the June 15 and August 27 Draft Decisions of ALJ Barnett?  If not July 1, 2001, what other date or dates should the Commission consider and why?

3.      Are there alternatives to suspending direct access as of a date before September 20, 2001, that would still alleviate cost-shifting problems?  What are the pros and cons of these alternatives?  Can the Commission adopt any such proposed alternative without new legislation?  

4.      What effect, if any, should be given to renewals of contracts originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commission's suspension of direct access?

5.      What effect, if any, should be given to provisions in contracts (""add-on provisions"") that allow the buyer to add more facilities to be served after the date on which direct access is suspended?

6.      Are there any other types of contract provisions that the Commission should consider in terms of applying the suspension as set forth in D.01-09-060 or the Commission's consideration of an early suspension date?

7.      If any party has in its possession any of the following, please provide: 

a.     Copies of various types of contracts executed or agreements entered into between electric service providers and direct access customers.[3]

b.     Copies of various types of contracts or agreements offered but not executed or entered into between electric service providers and direct access customers.[4]

c.      Copies of blank direct access contracts, not otherwise provided in 7a or 7b.

8.      For electric service providers:

a.     How many contracts have you executed or entered into with direct access customers between January 17, 2001 and September 20, 2001?   How much load is contracted for in each of these contracts?  Please provide the information by dates of execution.

b.  What percentage of your total direct access contracts contains any renewal provision?   What percentage of your total direct access contracts contains any add-on provision? 


  _____  

[1] The information contained in Appendix A is taken from Statewide Summaries in the Direct Access Implementation Activities Reports from January 15, 2001 to October 15, 2001, that is publicly available on the CPUC website.  The summaries were produced from information filed by the utilities on a monthly basis.  (See Opinion Extending Certain Monthly Reporting Requirements [D.00-12-036] (2000) ___ Cal.P.U.C.2d ___.)

[2] The general magnitude of potential cost shifting can be seen by referring to DWR's most recent revenue requirement draft submission, dated October 19, 2001, of which official notice is taken.  The revenue requirement from ratepayers contained in DWR's most recent submission is $10.189 billion for the twenty-four calendar months of 2001 and 2002.

[3] Information about the customer (e.g., name, address, etc.) and pricing may be redacted from these copies.  Date of execution or signing should not be redacted.

[4] Information about the customer (e.g., name, address, etc.) and pricing may be redacted from these copies.   Any information regarding the dates of the offer should not be redacted.

  _____  

 
Finally, Wood says that it is his, ""current plan that a decision regarding the above will be issued based on the written comments filed by the parties.  If any party believes that an evidentiary hearing is needed, it must make such a request in its comments.  The requesting party must set forth in detail what material factual issues are in dispute, why those facts are material, and what evidence would be presented in an evidentiary hearing on such issues.""

Air raids

America's war against terrorism seemed to enter a new phase after details were released of a raid by airborne forces on a target inside Afghanistan, though expected follow-up attacks did not materialise. Air raids on the country continued: Taliban spokesmen claimed many civilian casualties. America admitted that some ""collateral damage"" may have occurred.

See article: Fighting terrorism <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31724_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_55>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>


More anthrax

	
	 Reuters <http://www.economist.com/images/20011027/4301WW1.jpg>	
	
	
	

Two Washington postal workers, from the office that handled the contaminated letter sent to Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, died from inhalation anthrax, the most deadly form of the disease. Several other workers from the same office were suspected of having the disease, as was a worker from a sorting office in Trenton, New Jersey. Mass testing of postal workers began in Washington, DC, New Jersey and New York.

See article: Coping with the anthrax outbreak <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31723_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_54>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Anthrax spores were also found in a military building that handles mail addressed to the White House. John Potter, the postmaster-general, said he could not guarantee that any American mail was safe.

See article: The postal service's troubles <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31722_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_53> 

Canada relented after threatening to circumvent a patent on Cipro, an antibiotic for the treatment of anthrax, and obtain supplies from a generic-drug company. Bayer, Cipro's maker, agreed to provide as much of the drug as Canada needed to allay public fears. The United States threatened to override the patent if Bayer did not drop its prices-which it then did.

See article: Patents, anthrax and antibiotics <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31721_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_52>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

The House of Representatives approved the president's anti-terrorism measures, which will now be taken up by the Senate.


Israel defiant

In a ferocious week-long assault that claimed more than 40 Palestinian lives, Israeli tanks and infantry reoccupied parts of six Palestinian-controlled cities. The declared aim was to arrest militants, including the group that killed an Israeli minister last week. America brusquely demanded that the tanks be withdrawn. The Israelis took their time.

See article: Pull back the tanks, says Bush to Sharon <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31729_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_5a>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

After militants in central Nigeria killed 19 soldiers, armed men in civilian clothing attacked four villages, killing some 200 people. The army denied responsibility. Renegade soldiers are suspected.

A group of Commonwealth ministers visited Zimbabwe to investigate whether the government had acted on promises, made last month at a meeting in Nigeria, to end farm invasions and restore the rule of law. Few expected them to come up with a positive answer. Amnesty International reported that government-backed murders were increasing.

A South African mob attacked hundreds of Zimbabwean immigrants living in shacks near Johannesburg, accusing them of stealing jobs, and of various crimes. Hostility towards Zimbabweans has been rising across the country.


The fatal shore

At least 350 people, mostly Iraqi asylum-seekers, died when their overladen boat sank after leaving Indonesia bound for Australia. Australia said it had identified an Egyptian in Jakarta who had organised the voyage.

Thirteen people died in shooting incidents in Indian Kashmir, bringing to at least 150 the toll since militant protest flared after America started bombing Afghanistan. In a separate development, 20 Pakistanis training in Afghanistan for operations in Kashmir were reported killed by American bombs.


Innocent and guilty

Under heavy pressure from America and its own political wing, the Provisional (ie, mainstream) IRA began putting some of its weapons ""beyond use"". No details or numbers, but Northern Ireland's first minister, David Trimble, gave the news a hearty welcome.

See article: The IRA has put the peace process back on track <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31728_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_59>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Britain's government eased the country's drug laws. Possessing small amounts of cannabis will no longer result in arrest and medicinal use is likely to be sanctioned.

Italy's final appeals court cleared the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, of involvement in bribing tax inspectors dealing with three companies in his Fininvest group. However, the court found several Fininvest managers guilty for their role in the bribery.

In Berlin, the Democratic Socialists-heirs of the communists who ran East Germany for the Russians-took 23% of the vote in the election for a new state administration.

Macedonia's official police began patrolling areas formerly controlled by ethnic-Albanian guerrillas. Hardly had they left one village than its police station was blown up. Bad news for the peace deal, still not put into law by the parliament.

See article: A bombshell in Macedonia <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31732_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_54>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

In Galicia, Spain's north-western province, over 50% of the vote in a regional election went to the governing People's Party, ensuring a fourth consecutive term as premier for its leader, Manuel Fraga.

See article: Charlemagne: Manuel Fraga, premier of Galicia <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31731_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_53>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Two trucks crashed head-on and caught fire in Switzerland's St Gotthard road tunnel. Ten people died and more than 80 are still missing.


Swap or default?

Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, made an unannounced visit to New York, apparently to try to persuade bankers of the virtues of a debt swap that rating agencies say may amount to a default. The government held back planned economic measures, after talks with provincial governors over budget cuts dragged on.

After 30 years of debate, Mexico's transport ministry at last decided on the site for a new international airport for Mexico city. It will be built on the dried-up bed of Lake Texcoco. The city's mayor said he would challenge the decision in the courts.

See article: Mexico's overdue new airport <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31734_6557507_2_80010922_60368779_1_56>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

A leading human-rights lawyer was murdered in Mexico. Investigators suspected the army of being behind her death.

Hello everyone,

If you're in San Francisco this Friday, come join Enlai, Rolf, Gerry and 
myself at Kell's for a drink.  We plan to meet there at 6, and everyone is 
welcome!  I know it may be tough to choose between Kell's in the City and 
Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto, so just let your Friday afternoon location make 
the choice for you.

Kell's Irish Restaurant & Bar is located at 530 Jackson St.  The cross street

Hope you can make it.

Honoring the Sacrifice


By Michael Toms

=20

""We must guard against the military industrial complex""

                                                --Dwight D. Eisenhower

                                                   1960 Farewell Address

=20

This morning I pulled up ABC News on-line, that's Australian Broadcasting, =
not American Broadcasting, and the lead story was titled, ""Afghans Tell of =
Attack Horror.""  The story was based on the reporting of approximately twen=
ty foreign journalists who arrived in Afghanistan for the first time since =
the American-led air strikes began on Oct. 7th.  These journalists saw civi=
lian casualties and talked with civilians whose villages had been bombed wi=
th estimates of the death toll ranging from 180 to 230 in one village.  One=
 Afghan farmer was quoted as saying, ""I lost my four daughters, my son and =
my wife in this attack.""  Of course, the Taliban want to appeal to internat=
ional public opinion by allowing previously forbidden foreign journalists i=
nto Afghanistan.  However, this does not diminish the fact that American bo=
mbing is killing innocent civilians. =20

=20

On September 11, 2001 nearly 6000 human beings sacrificed their lives.  The=
se individuals were from more than eighty countries.  This tragedy is not j=
ust an American event; it is a world event.  Sacrifice is a noble word.  It=
 means to ""make sacred.""  The deaths of more innocent civilians do not hono=
r the sacrifice that these people have made.  Do not misunderstand me, I su=
pport justice being meted out to the criminals who perpetrated this horrifi=
c event.  The bombing of Afghanistan is not justice.  It is vengeance roote=
d in anger.  As Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us before, v=
iolence begets violence; it is never the answer.  When Timothy McVeigh was =
found guilty in an American court of law of blowing up the Oklahoma City Fe=
deral Office Building, he was eventually executed for his crime.  We didn't=
 execute his family, or his friends, or his community.  That was justice wi=
thin the American system.  This ""war on terrorism"" is not justice.  Despite=
 our government's attempts to propagandize this war with the assistance of =
the major mass media, we are killing innocent civilians.  How are they diff=
erent from the innocents killed in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?=
  At the same time more than six million Afghan civilians are starving and =
the situation is being exacerbated, because they can't get UN relief becaus=
e of the bombing. =20

=20

I am an American patriot.  I love this country.  I love this planet.  As su=
ch, I have a responsibility as a citizen living in a democracy to speak out=
 and question the decisions that are being made on my behalf by this govern=
ment using my tax dollars.  The American Revolution arose from dissent and =
the desire to escape the tyranny of King George and the British Empire at t=
hat time.  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill =
of Rights, are all about the sovereign voice of the people in a democracy. =
 The Constitution begins with,  ""We the People of the United States . . ."" =
 The people are the sovereign voice in America.  The government works for u=
s, not the other way around.  We have a right to question and challenge the=
 decisions of our government leaders.  Indeed it is our responsibility to d=
o so.  With freedom comes responsibility.  I encourage you to speak out and=
 express your voice, however you can; in community, meet with your friends,=
 neighbors, colleagues, write letters to elected officials, call them on th=
e telephone, contact the media and tell them to report the full story of wh=
at is happening in Afghanistan.  These are perilous times.  The tragic even=
ts of 9/11/01 have given us an opportunity to recover our bearings, to revi=
sit the founding principles of this nation, which were inspired by the Nati=
ve peoples of this land.  The Iroquois Confederacy and its democratic princ=
iples inspired Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and others. =
 This is a time to recover those principles and create a world that works f=
or all.  As President Lincoln so eloquently expressed at the dedication of =
the Gettysburg national cemetery, "". . . That we here highly resolve that t=
hese dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall ha=
ve a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people=
, for the people, shall not perish from this earth.""=20

I took the plunge and got LASIK about a month ago. 
Amazing to be without glasses or contacts for the
first time in 20 years.  VERY convenient.  

Although some people tell me they miss the specs on
me.

Staying aloft

	
	  <http://www.economist.com/images/20011027/4301WW3.jpg>	
	
	
	

Switzerland's federal government, some cantons and some of the country's biggest companies-including Nestl?, Novartis, UBS and Credit Suisse-decided that a national airline was required irrespective of cost. Although most national airlines look in a sorry state, government and business stumped up SFr4.24 billion ($2.6 billion) to recapitalise Crossair, a Swiss regional airline that will take over two-thirds of bankrupt Swissair's aircraft and routes.

See article: Europe's airlines and subsidies <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31713_6557115_2_80010922_60368779_1_4e>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Britain and America resumed talks aimed at an ""open skies"" agreement that would allow more airlines to ply their trade between the two countries, and would persuade America's antitrust authorities to allow an alliance between BA and American Airlines. The French government confirmed a similar deal to enable an alliance between Air France and Delta. BA also began alliance talks with KLM Royal Dutch; other European airlines are likely to seek allies.


America's bad results

America's biggest companies had a tough week. AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the world's biggest, reported a loss of $525m in the latest quarter, including losses related to September 11th, compared with a profit of $322m last year. 

Viacom, an American media giant that owns CBS, MTV and Paramount Pictures among others, announced a net loss of $190m in the third quarter, partly as a result of lost advertising revenue after September 11th.

See article: Media and the economic downturn <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31712_6557115_2_80010922_60368779_1_4d> 

Lucent Technologies, an American telecoms-equipment maker, reported losses in the latest quarter of $8.8 billion compared with $484m in the same period last year. Much of the loss is accounted for by restructuring costs that will see its workforce reduced by almost half, to as few as 57,000 by March next year.

Honeywell lost $308m in the third quarter after restructuring costs of $1 billion. It also said 4,100 jobs would go next year in addition to 15,800 announced in September.

Xerox announced a fifth consecutive quarterly loss, of $211m, slightly more than a year ago. The copier company has spent some years in the doldrums and claimed that a restructuring plan had been put back by the aftermath of September 11th.

Profits at ExxonMobil, the world's biggest publicly-traded oil company, fell by 23% in the third quarter, to $3.3 billion, compared with the same period the year before when the company made the highest profits ever recorded by an American company. Falling oil prices are largely to blame.

Enron's share price suffered a second blow a week after its third-quarter results showed a one-off charge of $1 billion related to investments that had gone awry. Investors took further fright after the energy-trading giant admitted that one of the deals, involving its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had caught the eye of America's Securities and Exchange Commission, which then started an informal investigation of Enron. Mr Fastow is being replaced. 

America's International Trade Commission agreed with the country's steel companies that foreign competition was adversely affecting domestic producers. This opens the way for the government to introduce tariffs and quotas on foreign steel. The European Union threatened action through the WTO if restrictions were introduced.


Sent packing?

It was reported that the European Commission would block a euro1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) purchase by France's Tetra Laval of a rival Swedish packaging company, Sidel. The Commission fears for competition in the drinks-packaging market.

America's Federal Trade Commission voted to block the $8.2 billion sale of Seagram's drink businesses to Diageo, a British drink company, fearing that it would create a rum duopoly with Bacardi. Diageo said it would give up the Malibu rum brand to prevent the deal from being beached.

Germany's Ifo business-climate index plummeted to its lowest level since 1993 and its biggest monthly fall since 1973-worrying signs that Europe's largest economy is leading the way toward recession.

See article: Germany's troubled economy <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31714_6557115_2_80010922_60368779_1_4f>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>


Japan's losses

Fujitsu announced losses of ?175 billion ($1.4 billion) in the six months to September. The Japanese electronics giant suffered from the falling demand for chips and telecoms equipment. The company added a further 4,500 job losses to the 16,400 announced in August.

Sony, another Japanese electronics giant, reported a second quarterly loss, of ?13.2 billion ($111m), in the three months to September. Weaker consumer demand has hit sales in America. However, the company's game division moved back into profit, thanks to rising sales of PlayStation2.

Japan's economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, said that redenominating the yen was again under consideration as part of wider economic restructuring; removing two noughts would bring it into line with the dollar and euro. The measure is more usually associated with countries that are suffering hyperinflation to restore confidence; deflation-stricken Japan would perhaps be better advised to add some zeroes.

Dorothy -- Attached is a another version of the letter that takes a little
different approach.  What do you think?  I worried that your first letter
looks a little like an invitation to pile on the exit fees, of all types and
in any magnitude.  I think we need to attack the premise that any DA causes
an increase in DWR costs for other customers.  Bill

Web 'Wayback machine' switched on

An archive of 10 billion Web pages, dating back to 1996, has 
been launched at web.archive.org.

""We created the archive in 1996 because we felt it was critical 
to preserve a permanent record of this historically significant 
new medium for the public,"" said founder Brewster Kahle. The 
project, developed in conjunction with the Library of Congress 
and the Smithsonian Institution, made its official debut 
Wednesday night at the University of California at Berkeley. It 
will assist researchers and people ""who just want to see how the 
media and our culture marked important historical events,"" said 
Paul Grabowicz, an assistant dean at the university.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax attacks see Web use boost

The president of America Online told a suburban Washington, 
D.C., audience that anthrax attacks against the U.S. postal 
system are likely to boost Internet use. ""It's incredibly 
positive for the Internet,"" Raymond Oglethorpe said at a 
breakfast sponsored by the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce, 
the Washington Post reported. He quickly added the recent events 
were ""unfortunate."" Oglethorpe also said the terrorist attacks 
have hurt revenue for the AOL Time Warner  subsidiary because 
the market for online advertising ""has absolutely gone away,"" 
the Post reported.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Online travel: up in the air

Travel service etailers are waiting to see if the nation's Big 
Three air carriers -- Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and 
American Airlines  -- follow Continental Airlines  in the 
latter's unexpected move to eliminate commissions on sales 
completed through the Internet. Northwest Airlines  took the 
same step in March.

Online travel market analyst Lorraine Silleo of PhoCusWright was 
puzzled by Continental's decision, according to a Los Angeles 
Times report. ""You would think the airlines would want to work 
with as many distribution outlets as possible right now to fill 
their seats, not take them away,"" she told the newspaper. But 
she also expects etravel firms such as Expedia  and 
Travelocity.com  will negotiate agreements with the airlines 
enabling them to make bookings and charge fees.

I agree with Bill's additions, with the exception of the sentence on DWR being
terribly misguided and therefore no one should have to pay the costs of going
100% to long contracts. Not sure who else we recommend pay for DWR power besides
customers.

I've attached the AReM letter in case you haven't seen it.....they go on quite a
rant.

VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	Proficient Networks emerged from stealth mode led by a team of executives looking to regain the winning touch. Proficient's four founders worked together at Digital Island and then moved to Telegis Networks, which got hit hard by the collapsing Web-hosting market and went out of business earlier this year. At Proficient, the team has built a network management appliance that enables companies to route network traffic based on their access policies. The company secured $6 million in Series A funding from Canaan Partners and El Dorado Ventures in May and is looking to raise $10 million to $20 million in Series B next year. 

Three mergers also topped the news as Netegrity bought DataChannel in a $54 million deal. Online newspaper classifieds firms, PowerAdz and AdOne, also linked up as did Intelliseek and PlanetFeedback.com. 

As the week grinds to a close, 12 companies reported raising $48 million. Proving that beauty to investors is skin deep, Switch Biotech, a developer of medications for dermatological conditions, scratched out EUR 18 million ($16 million) in its third round. And VentureWire has learned that Kyma Technologies, which develops nitride substrates for use in optoelectronics, communications, and microelectronics industries, raised $2.6 million in its Series A, led by a consortium of past individual investors. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

such an exit strategy than Matt L'Heureux,
Steve Smith, and Les Vadasz. Currently advising HP on
its $21 billion takeover of Compaq, Matt heads Goldman's
worldwide technology M&A. Steve built Broadview's
Silicon Valley business. Les, head of Intel Capital,

the relationship work. For straight talk from the voices

Unlocking the Promise of Good Science:
The Investor's Perspective

Good science doesn't always equate with good investment
opportunity. Generations of investors have been burned
and rewarded for taking risks on the potential of early-
stage therapies.  The drug discovery process is a complex
combination of tests and hurdles for young companies.
Where are the signposts for investors?  James Reddoch of
Banc of America Securities will moderate a special
roundtable dedicated to drug research and discovery at
this year's Healthcare Outlook Conference.  The experience
of the panelists reflects the complex considerations of
modern research and development.  Mr. Reddoch is joined by
Michael Grey of Structural Genomix, Daniel Janney of Alta
Partners, Gary Zweiger of Agilent Technologies and Lowell
Harmison, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services.

* Original Management Team Departs at RLX	top   mail <http://people.venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IJQQMHJNII> 	
HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Most of the original management team has left RLX Technologies, a supplier of Web servers founded earlier this year by ex-Compaq computer executives. Earlier this week VentureWire reported that Michael Swavely, formerly president and chief operating officer, had left the company last week, and that Gary Stimac, chairman and CEO, will step down from the CEO position. Company spokesperson Patrick Kimball confirmed that there have been additional executive departures. 

Among those leaving were chief financial officer, J Tempesta; vice president of development, Keith McAuliffe; vice president of systems engineering, Ronnie Ward; and vice president of business development, Bob Jackson. The company said it will seek replacements.

A spokesperson said that the executives chose to leave the firm as RLX underwent restructuring. In August, the company laid off 17% of its staff, or 20 employees, citing a slow market for IT products. 

RLX Technologies has raised $59 million in financing from ComVentures, IBM, Ignition, Soros Private Equity Partners, and Sternhill Partners.

BEDFORD, MASS. -- IntellectExchange, which assists companies in finding experts to solve business, technology, and research problems, said it appointed Jonathan Rubin as its first president and CEO. The new executive told VentureWire that the company is raising its last stage of seed financing. 

Mr. Rubin, 42, joins the company from E-Sync, where he was CEO. He was introduced to IntellectExchange through technology executive search firm the Onstott Group, based in Wellesley, Mass. He has also been named to the company's three-member board.

The CEO said that the company is raising its final piece of seed funding for $1.5 million. He expects to close the round by the end of the year. The company has raised $2.5 million from individual investors to date. The money will be used for sales and marketing and product development. The company could go after its Series A as early as the second quarter of 2002, he said. 

Mr. Rubin said the company is in the early stages of talking to two different companies about acquiring them. Both companies approached IntellectExchange, he said, adding, that if the deals were to be done, they would be in the form of cash and stock.

SOFT MARKET OPEN

Futures point to a slightly lower market open as JDS Uniphase 
(JDSU,9.96,f2) and VeriSign (VRSN,53.34,f1) issued revenue 
warnings with their quarterly earnings reports. The University 
of Michigan's index of consumer confidence is scheduled for 
release at 10:00 a.m. EDT.

Fiber-optic equipment maker JDS Uniphase said it incurred a 
fiscal 1Q loss of $1.2 billion or $0.93 per share. CFO Anthony 
Muller said the company would have lost $0.03 per share if 
restructuring and merger related costs were excluded, matching 
the consensus First Call estimate. JDS Uniphase blamed a slump 
in demand for telecommunications equipment for its woes, but the 
company's CEO said he sees a ""low-point"" in demand by December 
or March. As a result JDS Uniphase said it expects a loss of 
$0.01-$0.02 per share in the fiscal 2Q on a 10%-15% sequential 
drop in sales.

Biotech behemoth Amgen (AMGN,58,f1) reported 3Q net income of 
$0.30 per share, $0.01 better than the First Call consensus 
estimate. The company said sales of Neupogen, its treatment to 
prevent infections in chemotherapy patients, rose 2% to $353 
million, while sales of its two anemia drugs, Epogen and 
Aranesp, rose 4.6% to $520 million. Chief Executive Kevin Sharer 
said Aranesp will drive 4Q sales growth and fiscal year 2001 
sales and earnings should rise 10%-12%.

Internet security provider VeriSign reported 3Q pro-forma income 
excluding charges of $0.28 per share, ahead of the Street's 
expectations for earnings of $0.16 per share, but warned that 4Q 
revenues would fall short of expectations. Including charges, 
VeriSign said it lost $1.91 per share.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were narrowly mixed in early trading with some strength on 
the short end and weakness on the long end. The University of 
Michigan will release its index of consumer confidence at 10:00 
a.m. EDT. Analysts per Bloomberg are expecting a slight decline 
to a reading of 82.5. Also at 10:00 a.m., new home sales are 
expected to fall to a rate of 860,000 for September.

following the Nasdaq's 2.5% rise yesterday. Shares of mobile

wider-than-expected 3Q loss, after the company named Michael 
Treschow as chairman. As of 8:55 a.m. EDT, the Bloomberg 
European 500 Index was up 1.32%. 3Q Gross Domestic Product in 
the UK rose a better-than-expected 0.6%. The euro was little 
changed versus the dollar.

Japanese stocks fell on weakness in semiconductor and auto sales 
following the weaker-than-expected durable goods report in the 
U.S. yesterday. Chip maker Toshiba (TOSBF,3.85) reported a 
larger-than-expected loss for the six months ended Sept. 30. The 
Nikkei-225 Index fell 0.78% while the yen was little changed

It's 5 days before our Napa-Sonoma-Wine Trip.  I know all of you are anxiously waiting for this Saturday, but just forgot to actually sign up for the trip.  Seriously, the sign up has been slow due to midterms or other reasons.  We really need to know how many people can commit for the Napa-Sonoma trip, so please sign up by 3:00pm Wed, 10/24.
 
The wine trip will start off at Viansa with a Connoisseur Tasting and followed by a gourmet lunch in a reserved area of the Viansa hill top picnic grounds.  The Connoisseur Tasting includes food pairing and reserve wine tasting.  We will then move on to Gloria Ferrer for award-winning sparkling wines.  I have heard from several classmates raving about this winery.  It's a must see for those who have never been there!!  Finally, we will move on to St. Supery, situated in a historic landmark 1880 Victorian Atkinson House (now a living museum).  We will find exclusive St. Supery wines that can not be found anywhere else.  The trip is pre-negotiated at a group rate, one would have to pay much more to have the same type of experience.
 
Additionally, feel free to bring your spouse and significant others to enjoy one of your rare day-off from school and work.
 
Hope to see you all there!!

                           Issue 42, Volume 3

                     A weekly publication from the
           California Manufacturers & Technology Association
     detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE: ECONOMY CONTINUES SLIDE
10,000 Manufacturing Jobs Lost in September

The California Department of Finance reports in their October bulletin
that the employment and revenue picture in the state is not positive.
The most available economic data on the state do not yet reflect the
economic impacts or conditions after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
The Department indicated in their October bulletin that although too
little time has elapsed to accurately appraise the attacks? impact on
the state, it is reasonable to assume that the full impacts of the
September attacks will be quite serious, add to existing economic woes,
and are now only beginning to emerge.

Labor market figures in the bulletin for September reflect employment
status at anytime during the second week of the month, including
September 10, the day preceding the attacks.

   * Nonfarm employment, based on a survey of establishments, declined
     17,400 in September.  Industry estimates for September indicate a
     decline in construction employment, weakness in nearly all
     manufacturing sectors, gains in private service employment, and an
     anomalous drop in government employment.
   * Manufacturing employment dropped by 10,100 jobs in September.
     California?s high-tech specialties?computers, electronics,
     aerospace, and instruments?accounted for over 60 percent of the
     losses.  Only textile mill employment rose in September.
   * Service sector employment rose by 6,500 in September based on gains
     in motion pictures (3,800 jobs), social services (3,000 jobs), and
     engineering and management consulting (1,700 jobs).  These gains
     offset the fifth consecutive monthly decline in business service
     employment, which lost 3,000 jobs.
   * On a year-over-year basis, services added the most jobs, 66,100,
     followed closely by government, 61,100 and more distantly by
     wholesale and retail trade, 47,200.  Manufacturing lost 63,000 jobs
     over the year, with losses in nearly all sectors.  High tech
     manufacturing has been hard hit.
   * California's unemployment rate, based on a survey of households,
     inched up 0.1 percent to 5.4 percent in September based on a rise
     by 7,000 in the number unemployed.  A year ago, the unemployment
     rate was 4.9 percent.  The national unemployment rate, at 4.9
     percent, is up a full percentage point over the year.
   * Preliminary General Fund agency cash for September was $468 million
     below the 2001 Budget Act forecast of $7.451 billion.  At this
     time, it does not appear that any significant amount of this
     month?s shortfall was attributable to the September 11 terrorist
     attacks.  If a reduction in taxable sales occurred as a result of
     those attacks, it will be reflected in the sales tax receipts due
     at the end of October.  Any other effects on revenues, due to such
     things as the fall in the stock market or employment losses, may
     not be apparent for some time.  Year-to-date, revenues are $608
     million below expectations.

CPUC EXPLORES ISSUES SURROUNDING DIRECT ACCESS

On September 20, the CPUC suspended the right to enter into new
contracts for direct access. The CPUC left for later consideration what
effect should  be given to contracts executed before September 20, 2001,
including renewals of such contracts. (Previously the CPUC indicated
that it might suspend direct access effective  July 1, 2001.)

On October 23, Commissioner Wood issued a ruling asking for public input
on direct access contracts, noting that commencing on or about July 1,
2001, there has been an increase in customers switching to direct
access.

He states that ?there are serious policy concerns about cost-shifting.
If customers are allowed to switch to direct access, there is a
potential for these exiting customers to avoid helping to pay down the
unprecedented debt incurred by the State to help weather the energy
crisis. These cost-shifting issues are part of the Commission?s
consideration in determining whether there should be an earlier
suspension date and what this date should be.?

Some of the questions he asks include:

1)  Why should or shouldn?t the Commission choose an earlier date (than
after September 20, 2001) for suspending the right to acquire direct
access service?

2)  If the Commission should choose an earlier date, why should or
shouldn?t the Commission consider a July 1, 2001 suspension?  If not
July 1, 2001, what other date or dates should the Commission consider
and why?

3)  Are there alternatives to suspending direct access as of a date
before September 20, 2001, that would still alleviate cost-shifting
problems?

4)  What effect, if any, should be given to renewals of contracts
originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commission?s
suspension of direct access?

5)  What effect, if any, should be given to provisions in contracts
(?add-on provisions?) that allow the buyer to add more facilities to be
served after the date on which direct access is suspended?

6)  For electric service providers ? How many contracts have you entered
into with direct access customers between January 17, 2001 and September
20, 2001?   What percentage of your total direct access contracts
contains any renewal provision?   What percentage of your total direct
access contracts contains any add-on provision?

Also requested are copies of unsigned contract forms and signed
contracts, with names and other sensitive information deleted but
contract signing dates retained.

CMTA will be submitting written comments which are due November 2, 2001.

EMPLOYERS IN A QUANDARY ON TEMPORARY PLANT SHUTDOWN STATUS

The California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA) is
continuing to seek clarification from the Industrial Welfare Commission
(IWC) in regards to the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE)
Opinion Letter of May 30, 2001, Re: ?Deductions From Exempt Employees
Salary.?  This very controversial letter written by Mr. Miles Locker,
Chief Counsel, DLSE generated an enormous number of complaints from
employers.  Labor Commissioner Arthur Lujan suspended the letter on June
20, 2001 and requested clarification from the Industrial Welfare
Commission (IWC) of the criteria for determining the correct
interpretation of ?salary.?

However, the letter left reduction from exempt employees salary and
other issues raised in the letter unresolved and still hanging over the
heads of employers when they are about to enter the most frequent
periods of use, Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks.  CMTA believes that
the ?salary basis? test applicable to all wage orders should be
interpreted in a manner consistent with the ?salary basis? test in the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that California has consistently
followed over the years.

Under the FLSA the salary deduction for exempt employees is measured by
weeks and not months as opined by Mr. Locker under California law. The
opinion letter prohibited any deductions from exempt employee?s salary
in increments of less than one month based on the quantity of work,
quality of work and or business operating requirements.  Therefore, in
order to be eligible for the overtime exemption, the employee must
receive his or her full salary for any month in which he or she performs
any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked.  This is
a particularly onerous provision for manufacturers who have a long
history of temporarily shutting plants down for a week over such
holidays as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day.  During
temporary plant shut downs, employees are permitted to use accrued
vacation or other paid time off to meet the salary requirement for days
missed.

Employers are facing many economic challenges in our slowing economy and
flexibility is needed to improve efficiencies and control cost if
employers are to remain competitive and minimize layoffs. Employers are
already faced with high energy costs and double digit cost increases in
health and workers? compensation insurance premiums that only seem to
grow.  That is why the commission needs to take action now to clearly
and specifically state that California?s policy on exempt worker salary
deductions was, is and continues to follow the FLSA on exempt worker
salary reductions.

WASTE BOARD DELAYS ADOPTION OF CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGIC PLAN

In response to concerns raised by the business community, the California
Integrated Waste Management Board agreed earlier this week to delay
adoption of a controversial draft Strategic Plan.  The Plan is intended
to serve as the Board?s blueprint for resource allocation and
policymaking over the next 3-5 years.  Business concerns revolve around
the process by which the document was developed and concepts that
promote new taxes on products and packaging.  See last week?s article
for more information.

The Board will entertain further discussion on the draft Plan at a
November 7 workshop. The Board?s action should allow CMTA and other
stakeholders to engage Board members and staff in a meaningful dialogue
before the Plan is adopted.

CMTA REQUESTS JUDICIAL CLARIFICATION OF RULE GOVERNING INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY DISCLOSURE DURING LITIGATION

Acting as amicus curiae, CMTA has urged a California Court of Appeal to
provide guidance to the business public regarding the extent and
conditions under which trade secret information must be revealed in the
pre-trial discovery process in trade secret misappropriation cases.

The California statute which governs such discovery exchanges states
that a party claiming to have been injured from trade secret
misappropriation may obtain another party?s trade secret records only if
it identifies the relevant trade secrets with ?reasonable
particularity.?  The purpose behind the statute clearly is to protect
responding parties from fishing expeditions being launched outside the
scope of the dispute which is the subject of the lawsuit.  A trade
secret can be the most valuable asset of a business.  Moreover, it is
extremely vulnerable to destruction during litigation as its disclosure
can destroy its secret quality and hence its value.  Finally, and most
importantly, as parties to trade secret litigation are usually
competitors, revelation of trade secret information by one to the other
tends to have direct and harmful consequences.

Thus, the California legislature passed the statute to help protect
against unreasonable discovery practices which would tend to affect
adversely such material.  Unfortunately, the statute provides no
guidance as to the manner in which the parties must comply.   Ambiguity
in this area causes uncertainty and expense to business.

Wind Market Power 

As strong winds blew in from the west on October 24th, Community Energy and Exelon Power Team executives announced the five largest retail wind purchases in America's history to a large crowd of excited onlookers gathered for the dedication of two new Pennsylvania wind farms. 
 
Amidst cheers and applause, Mike Freeman of Exelon Power Team and Brent Alderfer of Community Energy announced that the University of Pennsylvania now leads the nation for the largest retail purchase of wind. The Penn Quakers are buying 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) - the output of five turbines or the equivalent of 5 percent of its electricity - from the Community Energy-Exelon Power Team's 15 MW and 9 MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset Township. 
 
With these turbines only just beginning to turn, multiple conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet retail consumer demand for wind energy. All those standing on the reclaimed mine land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power and the power of the retail marketplace.
 
Not far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring Nittany Lions of Penn State University. Penn State University is purchasing more than 13 million kWh, the production of three turbines, from Community Energy. For a land grant university, it's hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy farm.
 
In third place is Carnegie Mellon University, which created crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser, acquiring 4.8 million kWh. Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving, Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next year.
 
Rounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle, with purchases of about 4 million and 3 million kWh respectively. 
 
We urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples. If you are interested in buying wind energy, contact Community Energy at www.newwindenergy.com <http://www.newwindenergy.com>. 
 
In fact, if just 660 institutions buy at least the output of one large wind turbine, Pennsylvania's retail consumers can insure that 1,000 MW of new wind energy are built and operating. By harnessing the power of the retail market to wind power development, that goal is very achievable. 
 
Though not in the top five, the Environmental Protection Agency, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia have all also made major purchases. Every one of these purchasers understands the price of wind energy, but more importantly, they understand its environmental, public health, and energy security value, showing that Oscar Wilde wasn't right about everyone when he said ""nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.""
 
Stunningly, 75 percent of the wind power from these two wind farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind 1.5 MW machines. 
 
These turbines, which make 11-20 full revolutions per minute, are the largest manufactured in the United States, and their blades are longer than previously used to be more efficient in the moderate-but-steady wind at these locations. All told, they will generate enough electricity for 8,000 homes, or about 63 million kWh of electricity - with no soot, mercury, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or sulfur dioxide. In contrast, typical system power in this region would emit about 75 million pounds of carbon dioxide, 568,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, and 177,000 pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to provide the same amount of electricity.  
 
But aside from the important environmental benefits, the wind projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset counties. Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms, with the owners receiving $3,000 to $4,000 for each tower erected on their land, which they continue to farm. Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on reclaimed strip and deep mines. Construction of the two wind farms required about 40 labor years of employment and will require about four full-time equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites. The sites generate local property taxes and, if yesterday's dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication, at least a modest tourist industry! 
 
This was all made possible by a great project team and every member deserves a hearty ""well done."" Although construction only took about 4? months, project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about two years ago. Zilkha Renewable Energy, Atlantic's development partner, provided project financing, as did The Reinvestment Fund's Sustainable Development Fund, with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others. Exelon Power Team is the wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers.  
 
On a sad note, Nick Humber, an Enron Wind employee who was instrumental in moving the projects to fruition, died when his hijacked plane crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Another plane that crashed in Somerset County was only about 15 miles from the wind farm. Nick's contribution to the project leaves a stunning memorial, reaching into the sky, with clean, affordable, home-grown electricity that supports our communities. We are glad that Nick's brother was able to attend the dedication. 
 
As the tragic events of Sept. 11 spur renewed patriotism and interest in domestic safety, it is important to recognize that the Community Energy-Exelon wind farms will help to increase America's energy independence and security. More wind farms can only do us more good. 
 
""Conservation is a moral issue,"" said President Teddy Roosevelt, ""for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and continuance of the nation."" 
 
In these times, conservation of America's environment and protecting the nation's safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to wind and other renewable energy resources. To all involved with this project, but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelt's words, we salute you.

Google searches for subscriptions

Search technology company Google Inc. is reportedly weighing 
offering searches for a fee.

Subscription options could include ""vertical market"" searches, 
which could have an appeal to academic researchers and 
consumers, CNET reported. Medical information or technology are 
two areas reportedly being studied. A Google source said plans 
are still at the discussion stage, and no immediate offering is 
planned. ""Their big problem right now is that 70%  of their 
revenues come from advertising,"" Danny Sullivan, editor of 
SearchEngineWatch.com told CNET. ""You tend to get nervous when 
you're largely dependent on one thing,"" he added.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Cox cuts local Web sites

Cox Communications Inc.'s Cox Enterprises is pulling the plug on 
city site portals Miami and Los Angeles. Layoffs at the 
company's Web division, Cox Interactive, will include about 70 
employees, according to Newsbytes. The unit will continue to 
operate about 20 other local sites. The downturn in advertising, 
following the terrorist attacks six weeks ago, prompted Cox to 
reorganize, the company's director of communications explained.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Clear Channel, MTV regroup on Web radio

Clear Channel Communications  is expected to cut dozens of 
employees over the next two months as it closes the company's 
West Coast-based Internet division, the Los Angeles Times 
reported. Online operations will be shifted to operating 
divisions within the company; the radio and concert units will 
handle their own online efforts.

And Viacom's  Internet division has pulled its online radio 
stations from the Sonicnet.com Web site. MTV Radio streams are 
still available on its own Web sites. No layoffs are expected. 
Sonicnet continues to operate, however it is no longer offering 
radio, including personal playlists created by users. ""Strategic 
decisions have led us to indefinitely deactivate all personal 
music stations on Sonicnet.com,"" a message on the site said.

VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	Even as investments slow, top VC firms are still out raising more capital. VentureWire has learned that RRE Ventures, co-founded by James D. Robinson III, the former chairman and CEO of American Express, plans to close $200 million to $250 million for its latest fund by the end of the year. The firm also added Rich McGinn, former Lucent CEO, as an adviser. And Applied Materials remains undaunted by the recent difficulties of corporate investment units. The semiconductor firm plans to set up a venture capital fund to invest in new chip technologies.

Eleven companies did manage to raise nearly $125 million to close last week. Napster, which recently cut 15% of its staff, got a reported $25 million in additional financing from its prime benefactor, Bertelsmann. Also topping the list were mobile firm, Flarion Technologies, which pulled in $45 million and digital image sensor maker, Pixim, which got $16.5 million. 

With the tough times investment banks are facing, it's no surprise that LabMorgan, a technology investment unit of JPMorgan Chase, is adjusting to the chilly investment climate. JPMorgan installed a new chief, while cutting staff and tightening its investment criteria.

Unlocking the Promise of Good Science:
The Investor's Perspective

Good science doesn't always equate with good investment
opportunity. Generations of investors have been burned
and rewarded for taking risks on the potential of early-
stage therapies.  The drug discovery process is a complex
combination of tests and hurdles for young companies.
Where are the signposts for investors?  James Reddoch of
Banc of America Securities will moderate a special
roundtable dedicated to drug research and discovery at
this year's Healthcare Outlook Conference.  The experience
of the panelists reflects the complex considerations of
modern research and development.  Mr. Reddoch is joined by
Michael Grey of Structural Genomix, Daniel Janney of Alta
Partners, Gary Zweiger of Agilent Technologies and Lowell
Harmison, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services.

MARKETS LOOKING AT WEAK OPEN

Equity index futures were pointing to a downside open for 
stocks, continuing the overseas trend, as earnings season winds 
down. With no major economic news on the docket today, corporate 
announcements painted the headlines.

Satellite-TV service provider EchoStar Communications 
(DISH,26,f1) agreed to purchase General Motor Corp.'s (GM,45,f2) 
Hughes Electronics (GMH,15.35,f2) unit for about $31.5 billion 
in cash, stock and assumed debt after top rival News Corp. 
(NWS,29) withdrew its bid for the company. The deal values 
Hughes at $18.44 per share, a 20% premium to its closing price 
on Friday. The transaction would give EchoStar nearly a 91% 
share of the satellite-TV market, which could provoke regulatory 
scrutiny.

Commercial and military aircraft maker Boeing Co. (BA,38,f2) cut 
its sales forecasts for next year by $1 billion to $55 billion 
after failing to secure the government's bid to build the new 
Joint Strike Fighter. However, the company's CEO said that the 
news won't have a ""material impact"" on the aerospace giant's 
2001 outlook. The potentially largest defense contract ever, 
valued at nearly $200 billion, was awarded to Boeing's top rival 
Lockheed Martin (LMT,50,f2) on Friday.

Humana Inc. (HUM,11.20) reported 3Q earnings of $0.18 per share, 
in line with the First Call consensus forecast, on a 1% decline 
in revenues as the health insurer exited non-core markets. 
Humana, like many of the health insurance giants that have 
recently reported strong earnings growth, has benefited from 
increased insurance premiums and cost-reduction efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds rose across the curve as cautious sentiment prevailed 
ahead of this week's economic data, including tomorrow's October 
consumer confidence and 3Q advance Gross Domestic Product on 
Wednesday. Analysts per Bloomberg are looking for a 95.5 reading 
for consumer confidence, down from September's 97.6 level. The 
mean forecast for 3Q GDP is for a decline of 1.0% versus 2Q's 
0.3% increase. The more significant National Association of 
Purchasing Management survey and employment situation reports 
fall on Thursday and Friday, respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European bourses were weaker this morning with softness in 
banking, telecom and pharmaceutical shares. Shares of Morgan 
Crucible Co. (MCRUF,2.75) were being punished after the UK 
manufacturer of wireless components reported worse-than-expected 
profits on slumping demand. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was 
off 0.99% as of 8:52 a.m. EST. The euro was higher against the 
dollar as traders remained cautious ahead of this week's 
economic data in the U.S.

Asian stocks were lower with weakness concentrated in banking 
and technology shares, despite hints from Chartered 
Semiconductor's (CHRT,20,f1) CFO that the company may ship more 
chips in 4Q than 3Q as orders begin to pick up. Banks were lower 
after Japan's Financial Services Agency said that inspections of 
the nation's banks as part of the government's new reform plan 
had commenced. Japan's Nikkei-225 Index closed down 1.69% as 
industrial production for September declined a 
worse-than-expected 2.9% from the previous period's 0.8% 
increase. The Bank of Japan's Policy Board lowered its core 
estimate of economic growth for fiscal year 2001. Also, The yen 
was higher against the dollar. Crude oil climbed as Saudi Arabia 
and the United Arab Emirates indicated that OPEC was ready to 
cut output in the face of slumping demand.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:52 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 Index was down 3.5 points (7 points below fair value) 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 1.5 points (10 points below 
fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was down 39 
points (71 points below fair value) and the December crude oil 
futures traded on the NYMEX were up $0.33 at $22.36/barrel.

Tonight in Andersen at 6pm is your chance to learn how to turn your great business ideas into $$$'s.

We think that the student-led, student run UC Berkeley Business Plan Competition track record speaks for itself:
   * Earlier this year the Competition's first winner, Timbre Technologies, sold to Tokyo Electron for $138 
     million
   * To date, the Competition has helped entrepreneurs raise over $100 million in VC funding

So, if you have a business idea, if you want to find someone with another business idea, or you just want to find out more because you are simply interested, head to Andersen Auditorium at 6pm tonight and learn how you can become THE NEXT BIG THING.

This does not include the food donations, but there is so little that it would not make a difference. The barrels are looking extremely empty!  Please don't subject me to the embarrasment of giving empty barrels back to the Alameda Food Bank...  
There is one week left.  The competition ends this Friday, Nov. 2nd!  Everyone at Haas is encouraged to participate - including faculty and staff.

Key Stats:
Last year Haas finished 10th out of 18 by collecting 545 lbs of food and $3,507... that's only about 1 lb of food and $7 per student  (Oski and Blue each collected around $1,000).  We can at least do that this year.  The winning school (Michigan) on a per student basis collected about 25 lbs of food and $14 per student last year.

Cohort Coordinators:
BLUE - Meagan Schauffer, Julie Clugage
AXE - Clarke Miller, Grace Lee
GOLD - Geeta Chawla
OSKI - Diane Lee, Louisa Leung

STOCKS EXTEND DECLINES

With no major earnings news to guide stocks, equity markets fell 
as traders booked profits ahead of this week's potentially 
recessionary economic data. Shares of Boeing Co. (BA,35,f2) 
pressured Blue Chips after losing the bid for the government's 
Joint Strike Fighter contract to rival Lockheed Martin 
(LMT,51,f2) on Friday.

As of 11:58 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 
2.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 1.1% lower. The S&P 
500 Index was down 1.6%. Auto, aerospace-defense, retail and 
wireless stocks were among the worst-performers while 
oil-related, air-freight and select healthcare stocks paced the 
advancers.

Shares of Boeing Co. were under pressure after the aircraft 
manufacturer cut its sales forecasts for next year by $1 
billion, to $55 billion, after failing to secure a government 
contract to build the new Joint Strike Fighter. However, the 
company's CEO said that the news won't have a ""material impact"" 
on the Dow component's 2001 outlook. The largest defense 
contract ever, valued at roughly $200 billion, was awarded to 
Boeing's top rival Lockheed Martin on Friday.

Satellite-TV service provider EchoStar Communications 
(DISH,25,f1) agreed to purchase General Motors Corp.'s 
(GM,43,f2) Hughes Electronics (GMH,14.66,f2) unit for about 
$31.5 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt after top rival 
News Corp. (NWS,27) withdrew its bid for the company. The 
transaction will give EchoStar nearly a 91% share of the 
satellite-TV market, which could provoke regulatory scrutiny.

Shares of UAL Corp. (UAL,14.50) were higher after Chairman and 
Chief Executive James Goodwin stepped down as part of a weekend 
management shakeup amid mounting pressure from labor unions 
unsatisfied with Goodwin's performance. The board appointed John 
Creighton Jr. as the interim CEO to lead UAL out of its current 
financial duress. Goodwin, who spent slightly more than 2 years 
at the head post, exacerbated the unions' loss of confidence in 
his leadership when he wrote a recent letter to employees saying 
that the company ""will perish"" next year if it doesn't curb its 
mounting losses.

Leading express shipment company Fedex Corp. (FDX,41,f2) said 
that its fiscal 2Q profits would exceed the Street's forecast as 
losses from its air-freight business were buffered by a pickup 
in its ground operations and cost-control measures. The company 
now expects 2Q earnings of $0.40-$0.45 per share, excluding $101 
million in federal assistance following the terrorist attacks, 
ahead of the Street's $0.35 per share consensus, as the company 
expands its home delivery and business-to-business services.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds rose across the curve in a flight-to-quality move out of 
equities as cautious sentiment prevailed ahead of this week's 
economic data. Traders remain guarded ahead of the potentially 
recessionary data, including the advance 3Q Gross Domestic 
Product, National Association of Purchasing Management survey 
and employment situation reports.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European bourses were weaker this morning with softness in 
telecom, pharmaceutical and computer-related shares. Shares of 
Morgan Crucible Co. (MCRUF,2.75) were under pressure after the 
U.K. manufacturer of wireless components reported 
worse-than-expected profits on slumping demand. In the same 
sector, Ericsson (ERICY,4.33,f1) was slightly lower after 
analyst downgrades. Novartis AG (NVS,38,f2) pulled out of a 
collaboration with Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO,40) to develop a 
diabetes drug, sending Novo shares lower. The Bloomberg European 
500 Index was off 2.02% as of 11:58 a.m. EST. The euro extended 
its gains against the dollar on the heels of weakness in U.S. 
markets.

    Please keep me posted on the appeal process.  The California Cast
Metals Association encompasses over 80% of the casting tonnage poured in
California and is a heavy consumer of electricity.  We're definitely
interested in any work being done of DA.

Thanks,
James

Hi Cynthia:

I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today,
so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday,
Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM
(want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is
where I always rent).  Is this something that you folks generally
arrange, or do I just do it?  Is there a corporate account # I'll need
if I do it?  Really appreciate your help.

Best,
Jeff

Yahoo expands video programming

Yahoo  said its streaming-video service has added new 
programming, including cooking shows, a TV sitcom and highlights 
of a conference offering families and businesses help after the 
terrorist attacks last month.

The programs are free. Advertisers' messages are displayed as 
the programs are streamed. The announcement was made Monday at a 
conference sponsored by Webnoize, a market research firm 
specializing in digital entertainment technologies.

CW EDistribution LLC's contributions include episodes of the 
show ""Townies"" and clips from old TV commercials and celebrity 
interviews. ""It is the ideal platform for people to see shows 
they might not otherwise be able to access,"" said CWD's Robert 
E. Raleigh. Yahoo's broadcast service is also offering free 
access to a conference hosted by Franklin Covey, in which author 
Steven Covey suggests ways people can cope with the effect of 
the events of Sept. 11.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
More confidence seen in Internet

Online shoppers will be clicking and buying this holiday season 
because they find the Web more convenient and product selection 
more broad than bricks-and-mortar stores, not because they are 
afraid to shop in large public places, according to a special 
research report produced by VNU's ACNielsen and Yahoo. The 
latest Internet Confidence Index study showed a 9% rise from its 
level just before the terrorist attacks. More Internet users 
plan to shop online during Q4 (60% vs. 54%) than previously 
projected, the study determined. ""On Sept. 11, the Internet 
played an essential role for millions of people,"" said Rob 
Solomon, general manager of Yahoo Shopping. ""The [Internet 
Confidence Index] confirms consumers now recognize 
ecommerce-related activities ... are safe, secure and very 
convenient.""

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Web standard use for PC owners

Internet use is becoming routine for a large majority of U.S. 
households that have computers. Lisa Melsted, an analyst with 
the Boston research firm Yankee Group, said 76% of PC-equipped 
households use online and Internet services, 58% use their PCs 
for games and entertainment, and 30% access personal and 
household finance services. ""These results indicate consumers 
are incorporating the online channel into their daily 
activities,"" she said. The Yankee Group's survey found the 93% 
of households with PCs have access to the Internet.

Hi All,

If you are available to help us out tomorrow evening (Tuesday, October 30) 
at the Open House in downtown San Francisco, we'd be very appreciative.

We've had a few volunteers, but would like to have more current students 
present to answer questions for the prospectives. We're expecting a fairly 
large crowd in San Francisco and the more students that are there, the 
stronger the program will look to them.

The Agenda for the evening runs from 6:30 - 8:30 PM. The event is at the 
Palace Hotel in San Francisco (at Market and New Montgomery).

I hope you will be able to be there and help us market the program.  Please 
let me know if you can attend or not.

Thank you!

Hey, I've got a ""devil"" of an idea to try to keep our weekend from

Should we start emailing what we need to do/get?

I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that
there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g.,
oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc.

BERKELEY AND COLUMBIA ANNOUNCE JOINT EXECUTIVE MBA PROGRAM
The Haas School and Columbia Business School are jointly launching their 
new Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA program this fall. The new program is 
being marketed by both schools across the nation starting this week.

The Berkeley Columbia EMBA blends the distinctive strengths of the two 
schools: Wall Street and Silicon Valley, New York and California. Aimed at 
a select group of high-level executives, the new program will enroll its 
first class in June 2002.

The marketing launch of the EMBA program, which was originally scheduled 
for the week of September 11 was delayed due to the terrorist attacks in 
New York and Washington, is commencing now and will continue into spring 
2002. The EBMA program places a major emphasis on drawing applicants from 
the west coast. Information sessions for prospective applicants across the 
nation start on November 7 and will continue through February.

Information sessions will be held throughout California and western states 
as well as New York, east coast states, and the Midwest.
Upcoming information sessions in California include:
    Berkeley, Nov. 7, 6:00 to 7:30 pm
    Los Angeles, Nov. 28, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    Oakland, Nov. 29, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    San Francisco, Nov. 30, 8:00 to 9:00 am
    San Jose, Dec. 4, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    Sacramento, Dec. 11, 8:00 to 9:00 am
    Orange County, Dec. 13, 8:00 to 9:30 am
    San Diego, Dec. 14, 8:00 to 9:30 am

For more detailed information on these and other events, please go to the 
web site at:
http://web.haas.berkeley.edu/embaadmissions/events/index.cfm.

The EMBA curriculum will offer participants fresh insights into the complex 
forces of global, financial, technological and entrepreneurial changes that 
are transforming the business world. It leverages the schools' locations in 
two of the world's most important business centers - New York City and the 
San Francisco/Silicon Valley area.

""In today's turbulent business environment, executives must possess 
outstanding management skills and a keen understanding of the rapidly 
changing nature of the economy and business world,"" said Haas School Dean 
Laura Tyson. ""This unique educational partnership will develop leaders with 
the requisite vision and skills for success.""

Designed to accommodate the busy executive, the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA 
features a convenient schedule of 15 weeks of instruction over 19 months 
alternating between New York and Berkeley. The bi-coastal curriculum, 
taught by the faculty of these two premier institutions, will offer broad, 
general management courses with a strategic perspective, including a series 
of cutting-edge electives in areas such as IT strategy and international 
finance.

Companies sponsoring promising executives in the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA 
will see immediate benefits from the program, as participants are 
encouraged to apply cutting-edge concepts to their workplace.

In addition to receiving MBA degrees from both Columbia Business School and 
UC Berkeley, participants will benefit from a lifetime membership in the 
global professional networks of both schools that includes over 50,000 alumni.

UNDERGRADUATES COMPETE IN INVESTMENT BANKING CASE FINALS ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30
Haas undergraduates have a chance to tackle real-world problems with 
creative solutions every year in the Investment Banking Case 
Competition.  The Haas School's undergraduate program office and Goldman, 
Sachs & Co. are hosting the final event for the fourth annual case 
competition on Tuesday, October 30, from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the 
Arthur Andersen Auditorium. The finals are free and open to the entire UC 
Berkeley community.

Each year this competition showcases one of Goldman Sachs' recent 
high-profile transactions to give interested students an opportunity to 
demonstrate and further develop their knowledge and skill base. This year's 
case focuses on the recent sale of Cobalt Networks to Sun Microsystems.

Over 30 teams submitted cases to the competition. The final four were 
chosen on Friday, October 23. Each of the finalist teams will make a short 
presentation followed by questions from a panel of judges, which will 
include company management, investment bankers, members of the investment 
community, and Haas faculty.  The winner will be announced, followed by the 
judges' critique of the presentations, and a discussion of what actually 
happened during the sale of Cobalt Networks.  There will be time allotted 
for questions from the audience. A reception will follow the event in the 
Helzel Boardroom.

LEARN THE SECRETS OF POST-BUBBLE MARKETING WITH LOUIS STERN THURSDAY, 
NOVEMBER 1
Kellogg School of Management Professor Louis Stern will share his vision of 
""21st Century Marketing"" at the second annual David Aaker Distinguished 
Lecture Series in Marketing on Thursday, Nov. 1, at 5 p.m. in the Wells 
Fargo Room. Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis.

Last year a standing-room-only crowd heard Prof. Emeritus David Aaker, one 
of the world's leading authorities on branding, lecture on ""Brand 
Leadership"" as the inaugural lecture in this series.

Stern is the John D. Gray Distinguished Professor of Marketing.

""Perspectives about how to use the Internet and the web must be re-assessed 
in light of the hard lessons learned over the past several years during the 
irrational exuberance era,"" says Stern. He focuses on issues related to 
designing and managing marketing channels in his research. In the lecture, 
he will address changes to marketing strategies and tactics that are 
required in order to find the right paths to profitability in the 
post-Internet-bubble era.

TOP HAAS ECONOMISTS OFFER THEIR FORECAST FOR THE US ECONOMY NOVEMBER 9
One of the many benefits of attending the Haas School and UC Berkeley is

current economy. On Friday, November 9, 2001, at 4:00 p.m., Dean Laura 
Tyson invites Haas students to a forum on the US economy.

Jerry Engel, Rich Lyons, Ken Rosen, Hal Varian, and Janet Yellen.  Dean 
Tyson and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Ben Hermalin will moderate. 
Yellen, Lyons, and Rosen will give an overview of domestic and global 
macroeconomic conditions. Borenstein will speak on energy and airlines, 
Engel will speak on venture capital, and Varian will speak on technology.

Tickets are available in the degree program offices.  They will be 
distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. Standing-room-only tickets 
will be available the day of the event.

INTEL CEO TO SPEAK AT RESEARCH DIALOGUE ON NOVEMBER 14
The Business Faculty Research Dialogues bring major corporate speakers to 
Haas every year to create a continuing discussion around a central theme. 
This year the theme is ""Adding Value with Information Technology"" and the 
lineup of speakers is impressive.

First up is Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive officer of 
Intel Corporation, on Wednesday, November 14, at 4:00 p.m. in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium. Barrett has been in the news recently commenting on 
the possibility of the Windows XP release increasing demand for new 
computers. He has been fairly negative on this possibility, instead stating 
that Intel continues to focus on its core business.

Before joining Intel in 1974, Barrett was an associate professor of 
materials science at Stanford, where he earned his bachelors, masters, and 
Ph.D. degrees in materials science. He joined Intel Corporation in 1974 as 
a technology development manager. He was elected to Intel board of 
directors in 1992 and was named the company's chief operating officer in 
1993. He became Intel's fourth president in May 1997 and chief executive 
officer in 1998.

Barrett will be followed by Eric Benhamou, chairman of the board for 3COM 
Corporation and Palm, Inc., on March 15, 2002, and Eric Schmidt, chairman 
of the board and CEO of Google, Inc. in Spring 2002 (date TBD).

Haas Community,

This evening at about 5:00 p.m. we received a report that several piles of 
white powder were placed throughout the Student Services Building and on 
Gayley Plaza.  We barricaded as much of it as we could and the UCPD and the 
Fire Department responded to our call.  We quickly discovered that the 
white powder was plain flour that had been placed in Haas and across campus 
by a student Ping Pong club on a cross campus footrace.

The student group is in the processing of cleaning up all of the piles of 
white powder.  If you find any piles in the building that were missed, 
please let us know so that we can get it all cleaned up right away.

This year's trip is going to be fantastic!!

Itinerary

Bangkok, Thailand offers incredible temples, outstanding cuisine, fantastic
shopping and the friendliest people you=12ve ever met. Thailand is called t=
he
=13Land of a Thousand Smiles=14 for good reason.

Siem Reap (Angkor), Cambodia: The magnificent temples of Angkor have only
recently opened to tourism after years of civil war and unrest. Now is a
perfect time to visit these timeless wonders before they are marred by the
rapid growth in tourism.

Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam: This is the most vibrant and dynamic
country in Southeast Asia. Saigon is sophisticated, exciting and endlessly
fascinating, from its glorious French colonial architecture to its modern
club scene and nightlife.

Nha Trang, Vietnam: Endless white sand beaches, warm sunshine, tropical
breezes. Need we say more?

Singapore: We will only have one overnight in Singapore as a result of the
airline schedule. But what a great city to spend a night! Discover Little
India, Arab Street, pubs along Boat Quay or sample Malay cuisine at a hawke=
r
stand.

Details

NEW Low Prices: *
$2,085 Per-Person, Double Occupancy
$2,455 Per-Person, Single Occupancy

following up on a few things.  You may want to touch base with her re:

Subject: Save the Date: 12/09/01 - Jeff Walker's 40th


Hello Friends of Jeff Walker:

As you may know, Good Old Jeff will be turning 40 in
early December.  There are plans afoot to help him
celebrate in style, so we wanted to get a ""save the
date"" message out to everyone so you can incorporate
this into your busy holiday schedules.

We don't have all the details yet, but we're working
on an ""event"" and mid-to-late afternoon meal on
Sunday, December 9 in Napa Valley, California.  If
there is interest, we may also have an more informal
agenda and overnight stay scheduled for Saturday,
December 8.

Please email me back with the following information:
* Can you make December 9 in Napa? If so, tell us the
names of others you might be bringing.
* Would you be interested in arriving December 8?
* Can you offer assistance or recommendations for the
Napa area?

Also, please let us know if you had been planning
something for Jeff separately or if you'd like to help
us in our efforts.

Thanks in advance for your response.  If you'd like to
reach me by phone, my number is 650-465-9207.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

--Mike Mills

Hello Environmental and Energy Committee Members:

Please see the following request from Dr. Kenneth Lim of the BAAQMD.  The
information he seeks is in support of a petition for additional State
funding for BAAQMD programs.  I understand how short the notice is, but if
you can provide Dr. Lim some information, I think he and the BAAQMD would be
very appreciative.  If you would like to send me your data, I will forward
it to Ken Lim without your company information.

Sincerely,

Margaret Bruce

     Ms. Margaret Bruce:
     SVMG

     Hi Margaret:

     I had sent this message to Justin Bradley last week, but have not
     heard back from him.  I should have sent it to you also.

     I hope that things are going well with you.

     I'm trying to assess the emissions impact of increased Back-Up
     Generator (BUG) diesel fuel use from 2000 to 2001.  I need real data
     to support an effort to get state funds to help mitigate the
     additional emissions in the Bay Area.  This is NOT for compliance,
     enforcement, or rulemaking, etc. purposes.  I could use your help.

     I would need 2000 and 2001 data for diesel fuel use or hours of BUG
     operation:

     BUG engine, hp, fuel use 2000 and 2001 to date.  One comparison might
     be 10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     We want to verify, if it is true, that business and industry felt
     compelled by the energy situation to operate their diesel BUGs more
     hours and burn more fuel (fuel readiness testing and emergency backup
     power) than in past comparable periods.

     I was hoping that you could provide some actual use data for the
     back-up diesel engines at your SVMG member companies.  I would need
     specific engine information as indicated above.  The data information
     can be as simple as total diesel fuel use for the first 9 months of
     2000 versus the first 9 mos. of 2001.  Ideally, we would prefer
     10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     I'm seeking this information at your earliest convenience (by the end
     of the day Wednesday).  Please telephone or e-mail me if you have any
     questions.  My apologies for this short notice (I did send in an
     inquiry to Justin on 10/22/01).  Thanks very much for your
     consideration.

You may have heard, it may be a surprise
We're making a move, and we're hoping it's wise...

It was hard to decide to go or to stay
But MyFamily.com has lured us away.

It is a pretty cool gig as far as dot-com's go
The only catch is that it's based in Provo

No, not Provo Spain, as some might guess
The Provo in Utah where they drink much less

The land of mountains and rivers and BYU
And of course the Olympics of 2002!

So please come and see us whenever you can
We'll have plenty of bedrooms and a whole lot of land!

We'll snowboard and ski, we'll hike and we'll bike
See you in Utah!

Not necessarily for purposes of discussion on the SCE call, but for later
reference if we have to fight SCE over the justification for their crediting
proposal, I want to chime in with my critique of SCE's analysis.  

First of all, their example does not properly characterize the obligations
of the direct access customers.  A Direct access customer (with the same
hypothetical load as in the SCE example) did not pay the same $60 toward
SCE's procurement costs and transition recovery, they paid a lesser sum, $60
minus the actual PX costs for that billing cycle.  What the direct access
customer paid (assuming the PX costs were $30), was a contribution directly
to CTC transition cost recovery, in this case $30.   

When the price of energy exceeded the 6 cents in bundled rates for
procurement and transition cost recovery, the utility does begin to build an
undercollection from its bundled customers, and the entire $80
undercollection in the SCE example relates to the cost of power purchased
for the bundled customer but not recovered in rates.

The same is NOT TRUE for the direct access customer.  The negative credit
provided to the direct access customer is the same as the underrecovery from
the bundled service customer, in this case $80.  However, for the direct
access customer, this amount has nothing to do with power purchased by the
utility for the DA customer, and represents essentially a credit against
amounts overpaid toward the utility's CTC recovery in earlier periods.  

This is one of the many perverse effects of the residual CTC collection
mechanism.  If a fixed CTC contribution had been established from Day 1,
direct access customers could have continued to pay that fixed contribution,
also pay their $40 share of the utility T&D costs, and would not have had
any role in creating the utility's undercollection.  However, because the
CTC calculation was a residual calculation:  the generation component of the
frozen rates less the actual PX costs = CTC (which later became negative)
direct access customers' contribution to CTC was dependent on the utility's
procurement risk in the market compared to the generation component in
frozen rates.  This was also consistent with the notion contained in AB 1890
and the Edison MOU that the utility bore the risk of power price volatility
in recovering its CTC.

In order for direct access customers to contribute to CTC symmetrically with
bundled customers, when bundled customers no longer contributed to CTC
(because of high power costs) and in fact REDUCED the CTC collected (the
power cost undercollection was to have been paid first before CTC was
booked, but the PUC did not properly account for this until it adopted the
TURN accounting adjustment), then the CTC contribution of direct access
customers had to be proportionately reduced, and that is the function of the
negative CTC credit.

Thus, a reduction in the CTC contribution of direct access customers to
ensure they paid the same proportionate share of CTC as bundled customers is
NOT a matter which SCE is entitled to recover after the fact because they
sustained an undercollection of power costs.  The undercollection of power
costs was entirely their risk, and direct access customers paid their fair
share of CTC and that is all they had to pay, period.  The fact that they
paid less than SCE expected because the high power costs generated a lot of
negative CTC credits at the end of the transition period is one more risk
that the utilities assumed when they selfishly and foolishly promoted a
residual CTC calculation instead of a fixed transition cost recovery system
as was used in most other states.  SCE is entitled to NO recovery of its
undercollection from direct access customers.

As you can tell, I am more than willing to discuss this ad infinitum.  If
you have questions, please call or email.

Subject: Sue's Retort to SCE's Premise
Importance: High


I don't agree Edison's premise -- that ""direct access customers
contributed just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as
bundled service customers."" We need to make clear that we don't buy in
to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to
buy power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA
customers.  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load
coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was
the direct reason for the undercollection. I can make the argument that
the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.
I will explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 --
payments of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real
delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off.
One of the tradeoffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR
HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there
were high gas prices or bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed
and not collect their billions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk
they agreed to.  Now, they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that
money and more.  This is in direct conflict with the statute. I can make
the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and
therefore any undercollection is theirs alone -- now the CPUC can bail
them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject to any presumed
""undercollection.""

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to
do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and
the retail busness from T&D. So, they did a ""top-down"" calculation.
This meant that there had to be a ""credit"" put on the bills of DA
customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the
customers switch to DA. So, the PX Credit structure was a direct result
of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the
rates.  Next, although bundled customers rates were capped, the
decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for
DA customers -- their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by
their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed their tariffs with the
CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor
authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got nowhere, until
WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our argument
was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers
-- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities
avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is
fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have
thought we had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The
settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone
understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to
allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were
high. So, we have a legal right to receive the full PX Credit/Negative
CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated
with bundled customers. It seems as if we should be able to prosecute
this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an attorney) 

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

Sue

<br><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"" size=""+1""><b>Business this week</b><br></font>
<font SIZE=""-2"" FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" color=""999999"">November 1st 2001<br>From The Economist print edition
</font>
<br><br><br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>New driver</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Jacques Nasser, chief executive of <b>Ford</b>, was driven out. A worsening economy, on top of the recall of vehicles fitted with Firestone tyres, had led to a second consecutive quarterly loss. The Ford family, still owners of 40% of the company, decided to put one of their own back behind the wheel. William Clay Ford, Ford's chairman, will take over as chief executive as well.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_32393_6563487_2_80010922_60368779_1_5c"">See article:  The crisis at Ford as Jacques Nasser is ousted</a>
</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">A day later Jonathan Browning quit as managing director of <b>Jaguar</b>, a Ford subsidiary. The firm said his departure was unconnected with Mr Nasser's. Mr Browning was apparently unhappy about Ford's decision to create a joint committee of Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin, introducing a layer of management over his head.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">James Goodwin, chief executive of <b>United Airlines</b>, was ousted. He had added to the problems facing the airline in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11th with a letter to employees suggesting that United could &#8220;perish&#8221; unless matters improved. United's shares plunged and unions representing employees, who own 55% of the airline, demanded Mr Goodwin's head.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Software settings</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">There were reports of a tentative settlement in the government's long-running antitrust case against <b>Microsoft</b>. Lawyers close to the talks suggested that the settlement might leave the software giant's market largely undiminished. But final details remained unclear, and it was also uncertain whether state attorneys-general would be willing to sign up.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>General Motors </b>sold Hughes Electronics, owner of <b>DirecTV</b>, to <b>EchoStar </b>for $25.8 billion. EchoStar's acquisition of Direc<font size=""-1"">TV</font>, its only serious rival as a satellite-<font size=""-1"">TV </font>broadcaster in America, dashes Rupert Murdoch's ambition to buy the company and create a worldwide satellite network through Sky Global. But American antitrust authorities may yet block the deal.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_32392_6563487_2_80010922_60368779_1_5b"">See article:  The battle for DirecTV</a>
<img src=""http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif"" hspace=""2"" width=""17"" height=""10"" alt=""E+""></font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Ericsson </b>installed Michael Treschow as its new chairman. The former boss of Electrolux will see the mobile-phone company through a restructuring necessitated by slowing world demand for mobile phones and dwindling market share. Ericsson's workers noted gloomily that his enthusiasm for job cuts earned him the nickname &#8220;Mike the Knife&#8221; at Electrolux.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">As widely expected, Sir Peter Bonfield agreed to quit as chief executive of <b>British Telecom </b>in January 2002, a year ahead of schedule, after six years at the company. <font size=""-1"">BT </font>said he had completed a restructuring ahead of time: a measure required because Sir Peter had helped to run up debts of close to &pound;30 billion ($44 billion) through a series of ill-fated acquisitions and joint ventures. He will receive a pay-off worth some &pound;1.5m.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Fair exchange</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Euronext</b>, formed through a merger of the stock exchanges of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, succeeded with its &pound;555m ($806m) bid in an auction for the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe). The pan-European outfit beat off the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B&ouml;rse. The troubled <font size=""-1"">LSE </font>may now become a takeover target itself.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_32396_6563487_2_80010922_60368779_1_5f"">See article:  After Liffe</a>
<img src=""http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif"" hspace=""2"" width=""17"" height=""10"" alt=""E+""></font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Running out of energy</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Enron</b>, the world's biggest energy-trading company, faced mounting financial problems. Doubts increased about the company's unorthodox financial dealings and the potential liabilities they might carry. Enron's shares continued on a downward path to their lowest since 1992.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_32395_6563487_2_80010922_60368779_1_5e"">See article: A financial black hole</a>
</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Lockheed Martin </b>swooped to capture the biggest defence contract ever handed out by the Pentagon. Building America's next-generation Joint Strike Fighter could be worth some $200 billion to Lockheed's consortium, which includes <font size=""-1"">BAE </font>Systems and Northrop Grumman. The deal is bad news for Lockheed's main competitor, Boeing.</font></p>

      <p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_32394_6563487_2_80010922_60368779_1_5d"">See article: California's passionate Republicans</a>
<img src=""http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif"" hspace=""2"" width=""17"" height=""10"" alt=""E+""></font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Renault </b>and <b>Nissan </b>took steps to deepen their partnership. Nissan will take a (non-voting) 15% stake in the French car maker for some <i>euro</i>1.4 billion ($1.3 billion).

Members of the Haas community,

This evening at 5:00 p.m., Professor Louis Stern from the Kellogg School of
Management, will give the second annual David A. Aaker Distinguished Lecture
in Marketing in the Wells Fargo Room.

In his talk, titled 21st Century Marketing, Stern will address changes to
marketing strategies and tactics that are required in order to find the
right paths to profitability in the post-Internet-bubble era. Aaker
describes Stern as ""One of the best speakers in academic marketing. He is
always provocative and humorous.""

Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis so please arrive early.

Regards,

Ben Hermalin

Jeff --

First of all, I wanted to thank you for your positive comments to Karen about my work on behalf of Enron.  She asked me to stay on board on an hourly, as-needed basis while they try to figure out what will happen next year.  Although I don't expect much work, it's certainly better than being cut out completely and she mentioned that you had appreciated my help during the contempt negotiations.  

I don't envy Karen for her job at the moment.  I've been getting the clips and Houston doesn't look like a fun place to be right now.  I also don't think they're planning too far in advance.  Yikes!

I've got a couple of CPUC questions for you.  What's the process for making a presentation in regard to either a specific case on the agenda?  Is it simply a matter of being present during a public hearing, or is there a list of witnesses/commentors that you have to get on?  The reason I ask is that I've been approached by a potential client regarding some telecommunications/broadband issues, with an appearance at the CPUC as a news hook.

How far in advance is the meeting agenda set?  I noticed that a meeting is scheduled for Nov. 29, but an agenda was not available on the Web site.  Is it likely that it is still being compiled?  How do you get on the agenda?

Any light you can shed on this for me would be appreciated.  I don't know if this project is going to come through or not, but I'm not sure my possible client is any better versed on CPUC procedures than I am.  I figure at least one of us should know what we're talking about.

Thanks!  You might give me a heads up if there's anything on one of the upcoming Wednesday calls that you'd like me to comment on.  Since I'm basically on call, I probably won't dial in unless someone gives me a reason.

Best,
Ken",None,2001-11-01 13:52:33-08:00, ken@kdscommunications.com, jdasovic@enron.com, CPUC question,0

Internet Daily 
for Thursday, November 1, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Ecommerce crawls back from Sept. 11
 


Renewed interest in travel is helping online shopping activity 
reach a pace not seen since the terrorist attacks of September.

Hotwire.com, a discount travel service, said it has registered 1 
million new users since the tragedy. Daily sales and 
transactions are equal to those of the weeks prior to Sept. 11, 
said Hotwire president Karl Peterson.

ComScore Networks reported similar results in its weekly survey 
of Internet users' transaction data. Travel category product 
sales were 6% below pre-attack levels, the Reston, Va., research 
firm said. During the week ending Oct. 28, total domestic 
ecommerce sales were $974 million, 2% below the average for five 
weeks prior to Sept. 11. Don Hess, ComScore vice president, 
said, ""We suspect the needle is starting to move in holiday 
shopping, perhaps earlier than the industry might expect.""

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Internet World rescheduled to December

The ninth annual Internet World conference will be held Dec. 
10-14 at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City. 
The show was originally planned for Oct. 1-5. Organizer Penton 
Media  said the majority of exhibitors and speakers set for 
October have reconfirmed for the December event. Internet World 
will be held simultaneously with another show, Streaming Media 
East 2001. Keynote speakers at the shows will include AOL Time 
Warner  co-COO Bob Pittman, Real Networks  founder Rob Glaser, 
and Playboy Enterprises  chairman and CEO Christie Hefner.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
High-speed Net accessible to 75%

Broadband Internet access will be available to three-quarters of 
U.S. households by the end of the year, according to market 
researcher Yankee Group. That is an increase from 60% at the end 
of 2000. Cable modem service will pass 66% of homes compared to 
45% available for digital subscriber line service. ""Success will 
increasingly be driven by the network operators' ability to 
lower the cost of hook-ups,"" said Michael Goodman, a senior 
analyst. He estimated that cable companies spend an average of 
$360 for equipment to support a broadband subscriber. He cited 
this as a reason why cable companies, such as ComCast , are 
aggressively selling self-install cable modems through retailers 
such as Circuit City  and Best Buy.

Cornerstone is a pretty good place.  I haven't had any dealings with them
for a few years, but I know a number of people who have worked with them

WEAK EMPLOYMENT DATA FAILS TO PHASE MARKETS

Equity index futures were lower but climbing back from earlier 
losses suffered as a result of this morning's dismal employment 
report. The unemployment rate climbed to its highest level in 
almost five years as the impact of the terrorist attacks has 
served to prolong the economic malaise. In equities news, the 
Justice Department has officially agreed to a settlement in the 
anti-trust case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,62,f1).

The U.S. Justice department announced that it had agreed to a 
settlement with Microsoft, which will be presented to the 
Federal Judge overseeing the case today. The accord will impose 
a ""broad range"" of restrictions for the company lasting for at 
least five years. The 18 states involved in the antitrust case 
have not agreed to the provisions of the settlement and are 
expected to ask Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly for an extension of 
time to review the terms.

BEA Systems (BEAS,11.70,f1) reduced its 3Q and 4Q guidance after 
the bell last night and said that it would be forced to cut up 
to 10% of its staff, owing to the sluggish economy. The 
application server software maker said it expects 3Q earnings, 
excluding charges and items, of $0.05-$0.06 per share, below the 
First Call $0.08 per share consensus, amid lower than expected 
revenue. BEAS is forecasting 4Q revenue growth in the low single 
digits and earnings of $0.06-$0.07 per share, below the Street's 
mean $0.09 per share estimate.

Health insurance giant Cigna Corp. (CI,72) posted 3Q profits of 
$1.66 per share, excluding a $33 million gain from the sale of a 
reinsurance business, well ahead of the First Call consensus 
estimate of $1.58 per share. However, the company's medical risk 
loss ratio rose by 1.6%, suggesting potential profit margin 
erosion going forward. Medical risk loss ratio is a key measure 
of medical cost coverage ability.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Treasuries were mixed after swinging wildly following the 
release of this morning's weaker-than-expected employment 
report. According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate 
rose to 5.4% in October from September's 4.9% level. Analysts 
per Dow Jones Newswires were looking for a rate of 5.2%. 
Non-farm payrolls declined by 415,000, the largest one-month 
drop since 1980, after September's downward revision to a 
213,000 decline from the previously reported 199,000 drop. 
Average hourly earnings rose to $14.47 from the prior month's 
$14.45. The services-producing sector cut 241,000 jobs, while 
the manufacturing industry eliminated 142,000 positions. The 
bleak employment situation, reflecting the economic impact of 
the terrorist attacks, leaves the door open for continued 
aggressive monetary easing.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

Technology stocks paced the advance in Europe on the heels of a 
Semiconductor Industry Association report yesterday. The report 
indicates that September was the third-consecutive month of a 
decelerating demand slowdown. However, the gains were muted 
somewhat by the release of a worse-than-expected German 
Purchasing Managers' Index report. The business index for 
October fell to 42.0 from September's 45.1, its 
seventh-consecutive month of contraction. UK insurance giant 
Prudential PLC (PUK,21) said that it will cut 2,100 jobs to 
lower expenses. Consumer staples giant Unilever (UL,29) reported 
better-than-expected 3Q operating profits and stuck to its 
guidance for at least 10% growth in fiscal year earnings. The 
euro was slightly higher against the U.S. dollar. The Bloomberg 
European 500 index was up 0.43% as of 8:53 a.m. EST.

Asian stocks were mixed but mostly higher on strength in the 
brokerage and technology sectors. Results were mixed as 
semiconductor stocks got a big boost on the favorable SIA 
report, but electronic components maker TDK Corp. (TDK,47) 
posted weak fiscal first-half profits, lowered full-year 
guidance and warned of more job cuts amid waning demand. 
Although a Liberal Democratic Party panel is pushing for 
inflation targets in Japan, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami 
called the idea ""absurd,"" despite rhetoric from the BOJ Finance 
Minister aimed at mitigating deflationary pressures. The yen was 
slightly higher against the dollar.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:53 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was unchanged (1 point below fair value) while the 
Nasdaq 100 index was also unchanged (7 points below fair value). 
The December DJIA futures contract was down 15 points (27 points 
below fair value) and the December crude oil futures traded on 
the NYMEX were down $0.12 at $20.27/barrel.

Comrades:

With a view to increasing the knowledge quotient of
the collective student body regarding the spring
electives, the EMBAA and SAC are soliciting the views
of the veterans among us (you know the ones:  we are
those who wear eyepatches, prosthetic limbs and mumble
incoherently to ourselves most of the day) who may
have constructive opinions about classes they have
taken at Haas outside the core.   

Our hope is to gather, edit and package (that means
make suitable for readers of all ages) these remarks
prior to registration for Spring Semester--which is
week after next, for the schedule-challenged among
us--in order to provide some helpful guidance from our
peers to answer that pesky little question, "" What the
heck should I take now!""

Please send your comments to Joe Tambornino,
tamborni@haas.berkeley.edu, by Tuesday the 5th, and we
will endeavor to supply you with THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE
TO HAAS SPRING ELECTIVES by the end of the week, which
shall include commentary, course descriptions,
information on new professors, etc.

Thanks very much for your help,

Ken Bruce, president - EMBAA
Joseph Tambornino, chairman - SAC

CMTA PARTICIPATES IN GOVERNOR'S ECONOMIC SUMMIT
Press Release

Today at Governor Davis? Economic Summit at Walt Disney Studios in
Burbank, California, the California Manufacturers & Technology
Association (CMTA) proposed three recommendations to help bring
immediate relief to the state's faltering economy.

?California is in a dramatic economic decline,? said CMTA President Jack
M. Stewart.  ?Manufacturing employment is down 63,000 this year and by
more than 10,000 jobs in September alone. The state's unemployment rate
has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months, peaking at its
present 5.4 percent.?

?It's time for the state to implement new policies that will incent
investment sooner rather than later,? said Stewart.

CMTA today will introduce proposals to:

   * Implement a Sales Tax Exemption
     (http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201) on Manufacturing,
     Processing and Telecommunications Equipment
   * Reduce Electricity Rates
     (http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201) and Provide
     Customer Choice in Energy
   * Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees
     (http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201) and Taxes

These initiatives will comprise the association's focus in the coming
months, and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members.

?The costs associated with a battered business community are not only
measured by stock-tickers and cable financial networks.  They are the
human toll of jobs that are lost, mortgages that fail and families that
go with less,? added Stewart.  ?These measures will restore confidence
in every manufacturers? ability to remain productive and allow them to
reinvest in the state's workforce.?

California's manufacturing sector currently produces:

   * 80 percent of state exports
   * One sixth of state payroll
   * 40 percent higher wages than the statewide average
   * And for every manufacturing job, an additional 1-3 jobs are
     produced

?These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message
to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state
will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help
California through this economic crisis,? concluded Stewart.


BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS

According to just released data from Venture Economics and  the National
Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture capital investment in the
Bay Area during the 3rd quarter dropped 27 percent over the 2nd quarter
of this year. Investment has slowed significantly this year and the 3rd
quarter investment is 74 percent lower than the $9.3 billion high
reached during the 2nd quarter of 2000.

The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for
the 3rd quarter. Venture capitalists invested $7.7 billion nationally
during the quarter, down 31 percent from the previous quarter, and 73
percent from the $28.5 billion high of last year.

?Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors,
the venture industry will persevere. Veterans in our industry recognize
this downturn as part of the long-term venture capital cycle. Real value
can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs
with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas
through,? commented Mark Heesen, NVCA President.


CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE

At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association
(CMTA) and other employer organizations, Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB
1197 by Senator Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles). The bill would have
prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to
tend to a sick child, parent or spouse in any absence control program

Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick
leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child, parent, or
spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave
act that only applies to serious health conditions.  The provision
covers brief illnesses such as colds, high temperature, sore throats
etc., that are more likely to be associated with children and is less
likely to involve physician or hospital care.  However, employers
opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy
threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions.

When employees don't show up or show up late for work, it negatively
impacts production.  In order to mitigate this problem, employers have
implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling,
suspension and termination.  After the above provision became law,
employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave
under this provision, so employers decided to include sick leave in
their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the
abuse.  SB 1197 would have eliminated that option and could have forced
employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem.

In addition to insuring that production schedules are met, the main
reason for an employer's absence policy is to provide a fair way to
identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work
as scheduled and/or on time.  Making a decision to sanction an employee
under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and
must be based on sound reasoning.  For example, if an employee's
attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick
leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays, Mondays and holiday
weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for
family member sick leave purposes, no disciplinary action could be
taken. In other instances, it is used to cover for tardiness that would
otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by
calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift
late.

SB 1197 would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the
statute where an employer has an absence control policy.  Consider that
employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only
apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their
employees.  CMTA discussed with legislators the counter-productive
nature of restricting an employer's ability to manage a voluntarily
provided benefit. When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult
to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations, it
provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their
sick leave program.

CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those
employees who have trouble getting to work under SB 1197 and could end
up eliminating the benefit for all employees.  CMTA applauds Governor
Davis's veto of the bill.

Hello all.  I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again.  As
for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX
credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the
""free-for-all"" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the
issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post  Jan 17 time frame
and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs
to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the
original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period.  Therefore, they will say
that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve
all the issues in the complaint.  I should respond to SCE's attorney soon,
so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar.  Is
everyone in accord?  Mike Day

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that
we don't want this ""payment of PX credit"" issue in this proceeding --
the ""free-for-all"" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I
am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the
impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

Dot-com layoffs rise

Plummeting air travel demand took its toll of Web travel sites 
last month and helped cause a 60% rise in the number of Internet 
job losses in October. Almost 5,000 positions were cut in the 
industry, according to a report by Challenger, Gray and 
Christmas. ""Sites specializing in airline reservations and 
travel planning experienced a substantial falloff in business, 
which led to over 800 cuts,"" he said.

Prodigy to sell Oracle Net device

Prodigy Communications  hopes to entice new customers by selling 
a low-cost Internet access device and offering them three free 
months of Web access service. An announcement of the offer will 
be made within a few days, according to CNet. The $199 device, 
known as NIC, was developed by Oracle Corp.'s  New Internet 
Computer Co.

Amazon.com, Citibank join for credit

Amazon.com  introduced the Amazon Credit Account, the online 
equivalent of a department store credit card. The account is for 
use on most of the company's Web site, but does not cover gift 
certificates or purchases made through partner Circuit City. 
""Amazon Credit customers can enjoy their purchase and hold on to 
their money for 90 days before making a complete payment without 
any interest,"" said Steve Frazier, vice president of hardlines 
at Amazon.com. Citibank's  Commerce Solutions unit is making the 
credit program available.

Xbox, World Series, anthrax boost sites' traffic

Fox Sports' recently redesigned Web site has experienced a 17% 
rise in visits, fueled by its TV network's coverage of the World 
Series and the site's own intra-game public opinion polls. 
Jupiter Media Metrix  also reported Major League Baseball's Web 
site saw its traffic fall 40% last week. Drugstore.com welcomed 
almost 1.1 million visitors during the period. That's a rise of 
67% over the previous three weeks' average. And Xbox.com has had 
a 54% riser in traffic (1.1 million visitors) as the Nov. 15 
launch of Microsoft's  new game console nears.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DC seeks kid-friendly Web zone

Members of the House of Representatives' telecommunications 
subcommittee are pursuing the idea of creating a kid-friendly 
area on the Internet. Sites designed for children could be 
established at a domain such as www.website.kids.us, and would 
bar pornography and other inappropriate material, Reuters 
reported. A proposal has been introduced by Rep. John Shimkus, 
R.-Ill.

PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT: THE CAEM GRID ENHANCEMENT FORUM
 
PROMPT REPLY REQUESTED.
 
A slew of new power control, management, transmission and storage
technologies are becoming available in the power marketplace to reduce
congestion, enhance performance and improve reliability.  These
technologies carry great promise for addressing some of the challenges
currently faced by regulators and market participants alike.  But there
appear to be significant institutional, regulatory and pricing barriers
to their widespread use.  In addition, the new technologies are likely
to present challenges of their own.
 
Accordingly, the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
(CAEM?www.caem.org) is hosting a consensus-building forum designed to
(a) achieve a common understanding of the grid-enhancing potential of
the new technologies; (b) use an intensive role-reversal seminar to
identify and highlight the institutional, regulatory and market design
barriers to the successful deployment of the various new tools; and (c)
develop technology-neutral recommendations addressing these barriers.
 
The project will begin in early 2002 with final policy recommendations
to be published by Spring of 2002.  The project is expected to have a
significant impact on decisions made by regulators, financial analysts,
utility executives, the media and potential customers.
 
For a copy of the proposal, please e-mail Philip Marston, the Project
Director, at pmarston@marstonlaw.com.  This forum is time-sensitive and
the number of participants is limited.", <909271.1075861503807.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,2001-11-04 22:10:50-08:00, hkd2061@home.com, jdasovic@enron.com, CAEM Important Project Announcement,1

Subject: Edison and the PUC


Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's
current financial ""challenges.""
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC
on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its ""undercollection""
under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers,
irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that
Edison 	accrued the ""undercollection,"" would be ""responsible"" for
paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once
to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that
your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of
this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around
based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are
required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the
iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force
all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings
are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all
of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff

I'll fax it to you shortly.  Could you give me your fax number to make sure
that I have the right one?  It's a Barnett ruling.  And I'm sure you've seen
and have commented on the Karl Wood's questions?  The hearnig on the 7th is
wrapping up a whole bunch of very thorny issues, including Wood's questions.
I believe that Barnett and Wood will be presiding.  Oh joy...

Several of the Lycos properties' home pages, including 
Angelfire.com, Familyzone.lycos.com and Holidays.lycos.com, have 
been reorganized to highlight news and information, rather than 
listing resources and columns of links.

""The new sites let advertisers target highly desirable life 
stages groups by putting their messages in front of users who 
are drawn to 'magazine cover' formats that aggregate the hottest 
news, tips and other content drawn from sites across the network 
as well as content partners,"" said Stephen Killeen, president of 
Terra Lycos U.S. ""We are trying to deliver (the) audience and 
put it in meaningful buckets for advertisers,"" added Rich 
Gotham, vice president for sales, Reuters reported.

Killeen also said Lycos has seen strength in Internet 
advertising sales, but could not be sure it was a result of 
renewed business confidence or holiday seasonality. He told 
Reuters the company will have more to say about advertising 
sales when the company reports quarterly results later this 
week.

AOL gets its way with Burger King

Diageo Plc's Burger King and AOL Time Warner  announced a 
multi-year marketing agreement. The companies said it is 
designed to build customer loyalty and increase sales at the 
fast food company's 8,300 stores in the U.S. One strategy will 
be to give Burger King customers codes that will allow them to 
access special sites through America Online www.burgerking.com, 
where sports and music promotions will be offered. Further, AOL 
is developing a ""BK Backstage"" custom site that will give users 
music and video content, free music downloads and chats with 
recording artists. Financial terms of the agreement were not 
disclosed.

United Way taps Web for help

United Way organizations across the country are hoping the 
Internet will deliver an infusion of funds at a time when 
contributions have fallen off. The United Way is launching One 
Day's Pay, an Internet-based solicitation asking people to 
contribute all or a potion of a day's pay to local charities. 
""The dramatic downturn in the economy ... has had a major 
negative effect upon local giving, at a time when people are 
looking for more help, not less,"" said Mark Germano, vice 
president of the United Way in Chicago. Another local United Way 
unit president said the drive is not meant to replace the units' 
annual fund raising. ""Participate in that and give more 
generously than ever,"" said Maria Chavez of the Orange County, 
Calif., chapter.

HAAS MBA STUDENTS TAKE TOP HONORS AT MARKETING CASE COMPETITION
A team of five Haas MBA students won top honors this past weekend at the 
2001 Elite Eight Brand Case Challenge at the Carlson School of Management 
at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.  Team members Anita Akerkar, 
MBA 03; Dennis Cox, MBA 02; Aman Desouza, MBA 02; Nate Kraft, MBA 02; and 
Sherry Lin, MBA 03 competed against seven top business schools including 
UCLA's Anderson, Carlson, Fuqua, Kelley (Indiana), Kellogg, Michigan, and 
Wharton.

""It was a great experience,"" said Sherry Lin. ""This really solidifies Haas' 
position as a top marketing program.""

The teams received a marketing case on Yoplait's Go-Gurt and were given 36 
hours to prepare a structured analysis and recommendations.  Go-Gurt is a 
$135 million portable yogurt snack brand that targets kids ages 8 to 12. 
After a strong launch, the brand was experiencing a decline in growth and 
increased competition.  The Haas team's suggestion included both deepening 
the relationship with the current target customers and expanding to a new 
market -- teenagers. What made the Haas solution especially appealing was 
the use of focus groups. The team rented a car and traveled to a local mall 
to conduct focus groups with teenagers to find out what would encourage 
them to buy Go-Gurt.

Each team presented its recommendation to a panel of judges consisting of 
executives from sponsoring companies as well as marketing professors.

In addition to Haas, other winners of the challenge included Northwestern's 
Kellogg School of Business (second place) and Indiana's Kelley School 
(third place).  Winners received $10,000, $7,500, and $5,000 
respectively.  3M, Fallon Worldwide, General Mills, Kimberly-Clark, and 
Philip Morris sponsored the event.
----------
  WIRELESS AT CAL: HAAS CONTINUES TO EXPAND WIRELESS COVERAGE
Wire-free connection has become reality at the Haas School. Wireless access 
services, such as e-mail and the web, are now available in and around 
select areas of the Haas School. The new service is part of UC Berkeley's 
pilot wireless LAN service, known as AirBears, which enables students to 
connect to the campus network if they have a laptop equipped with a 
wireless Ethernet card.

So far at Haas, AirBears wireless LAN coverage is available in: the Wells 
Fargo Room, the Haas courtyard, Jimmie Bean's Caf?, the Bank of America 
Forum, the MBA lounge, the undergraduate lounge, the MFE Collaboration lab, 
library group study rooms, the Bakar Computer Center, C230 sloped floor 
classroom, and F320 classroom. According to Mike Pivonka, the plan is to 
extend coverage to all Haas classrooms and major conference rooms before 
the start of spring semester.

Using the AirBears wireless LAN requires:
    + a laptop or other computer with 802.11b wireless ethernet card (WiFi 
certified).
    + a currently valid CalNetID and passphrase.
    + an SSL-enabled web browser (IE, Netscape etc.) on your computer.
    + an area with AirBears coverage.

AirBears is also available in the Cesar E. Chavez Student Center, the 
Bechtel Engineering Library study area, and the Doe Library study carrels 
(selected areas). It will soon be available in the Mario Savio Free Speech 
Movement Caf?; the Northgate Lecture Hall; and the Foothill Residence Halls 
(selected common areas). Please check http://www.net.berkeley.edu/wireless 
for updates on availability.

THE 24TH ANNUAL REAL ESTATE & ECONOMICS SYMPOSIUM: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE 
HOLD FOR REAL ESTATE?
Predicting the future of the economy and the real estate market in the US 
has always been difficult and has become even more so after the attacks on 
September 11. At Haas this daunting task will be taken on by the Fisher 
Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics (FCREUE) at its annual 
conference, which brings together leading experts from academia, business, 
and government to discuss and offer predictions on the economy and the real 
estate market.

The 24th annual Real Estate and Economics Symposium,  ""Adjusting to the New 
Economic and Real Estate Realities,"" takes place November 19 from 8:00 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m. at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.  At this full-day 
program, experts will talk about various aspects of the risks in the real 
estate business and how real estate will adjust to the new economic 
environment.

""The demise of the new economy and ensuing economic recession in the US and 
Silicon Valley, the energy crisis, and the post-September 11th 
uncertainties, have created an unsettled and clearly changing sea-level for 
real estate and other asset markets,"" said Bob Edlestein, symposium 
co-chairman and real estate development professor.  ""It appears in the 
short run that real estate is in troubled waters with its outcome depending 
upon how quickly we can stabilize the general economy.  It is likely that 
there's 'worse' ahead before things turn better in the real estate market; 
but, ten years from now, it is likely that our economy will be faring 
better and real estate will be a hot asset again.""

An array of experts will speak about the changing social-political-economic 
environment and its impact on real estate.
    +Kenneth Rosen, the California State Professor of Real Estate and Urban 
Economics and chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban 
Economics, will give his annual real estate forecast.
    +Bob Parry, president of the Federal Reserve of San Francisco, will 
explain how the economy and policy are likely to fare in the near future.
    +Michael Nacht, dean of the Richard & Rhoda Goldman School of Public 
Policy and former assistant director for strategic and Eurasian affairs of 
the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, will provide a political 
backdrop about security issues and their likely effects upon the US economy.

The complete agenda and additional details can be found on the FCREUE 
website www.haas.berkeley.edu/realestate.

All Haas faculty are invited to attend the symposium free of charge. 
Complimentary attendance is also available for students who volunteer to 
help out during the Symposium.  Contact Zee Zeleski at 
zeleski@haas.berkeley.edu to register.

HAAS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SHINE AT CASE COMPETITIONS
The undergraduate team representing Haas at the 2001 University of Texas 
International Business Challenge Case Competition in Austin, Texas, brought 
home both second place and the competition's Professional Excellence Award.

The International Business Challenge is an annual undergraduate business 
case competition held each fall at the University of Texas at Austin. Teams 
come from 20 leading undergraduate business schools from the US, Canada, 
South America, Asia, and Europe. The first place team was from the 
University of Hong Kong.

The teams were given a case depicting real-world problems confronted by 
Dell Computer Corporation and three days to prepare a solution. The teams 
presented their solution to the ""client,"" a panel of distinguished judges 
from Dell, Solomon Smith Barney, and other members of the business 
community.  Four teams were selected to advance to the final round.

""The Haas Team approached this case as a real client case and spent time 
analyzing the current market and how Dell could achieve a higher revenue 
growth,"" says Annie Lai, director of admissions and operations in the 
Undergraduate Program.  ""They not only presented a great recommendation, 
but also demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of global business 
issues.""

The Haas team included Eurie Kim, BS 01; Parizad Olver, BS 01; Megan 
Schofield, BS 01; and Julie Wang, BS 02. The faculty/staff advisors to the 
team were George Cluff, Steve Etter, David Robinson, and Annie Lai. Haas is 
the first program ever to earn awards at four consecutive University of 
Texas International Business Challenge Case Competitions.  In addition, 
case competition teams from the Haas Undergraduate Program have won awards 
in 7 of the 9 international case competitions they have entered since fall 
1998.

Investment Banking Case Competition
Back at home, the Fourth Annual Investment Banking Case Competition 
presented by the Haas School of Business and Goldman Sachs & Co. took place 
on October 30, 2001. Each year this event showcases one of Goldman Sachs' 
recent high profile transactions. This year's case focused on the recent 
sale of Cobalt Networks to Sun Microsystems.  The winning team included 
Joseph Spector, BS 02; Annabelle Louie, BS December 01 (business 
administration and mass communications); Peter Lee, BS 02 (math); and Tina 
Tong, BS December 01, (business administration and economics).

HAAS DOES WELL IN OFF-BEAT RANKINGS
As business school rankings proliferate, they highlight different strengths 
of MBA programs. In October, Haas was ranked well in three rankings: Beyond 
Grey Pinstripes' survey on social and environmental stewardship, Computer 
World's Techno MBA survey, and America Economia magazine's survey on global 
MBA programs.

Beyond Grey Pinstripes
The Haas School was ranked among the top 15% of business schools in the 
Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey released on Oct. 31. The survey was conducted 
jointly by the World Resources Institute and The Aspen Institute for Social 
Innovation Through Business in an effort to determine how well business 
schools teach their MBA students how to manage the social and environmental 
impact of business.

The top five schools at the cutting edge of social impact management were 
those at Harvard, Loyola Marymount, Michigan - Ann Arbor, North Carolina, 
and York University (Canada). George Washington University, University of 
Jyvaeskylae (Finland), Michigan, North Carolina, and Yale were listed as 
the top five at the cutting edge of environmental impact management.

The Haas School was listed in the second tier of ten schools having 
significant activities in the areas of social and environmental impact 
management. The survey specifically mentioned Haas for its Social Venture 
Competition, its participation in the Corporate Environmental Management 
concentration (offered by nine UC campuses), and for having an endowed 
professorship in the area of sustainable enterprise or sustainable management.

The survey weighed student coursework (50%), institutional support (30%), 
and faculty research (20%) to determine its top 15% of graduate business 
schools teaching social and environmental responsibility. Of the 463 
schools that received the extensive questionnaire, 122 schools responded.

The Techno MBA
Computer World magazine listed the Haas School among the top 25 
technology-driven business schools in its 2001 Techno MBA survey published 
on Oct. 22. The purpose of the survey, according to the magazine, was to 
determine ""which schools do the best job of combining good management 
techniques and technology innovation under the general heading of sound 
business practices.""

In its two-part survey, Computer World asked recruiters to nominate the 
best techno-MBA programs nationally based on their recruiting experiences 
at these schools. Computer World then asked MBA programs to nominate what 
they considered to be the best technology-driven programs (other than their 
own) and to submit information on their own programs and students.

The University of California was represented in the top 25 with three 
campuses - Berkeley, Los Angeles, and Irvine. Other top-ranked schools 
included Wharton, Indiana, Northwestern, Michigan, North Carolina, and UT 
Austin. Computer World did not assign individual rankings to these top 25 
schools.

According to Computer World, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Harvard, Duke, Stanford, 
and New York University were also nominated as top programs, but did not 
participate in the survey.

America Economia
The Latin American business journal America Economia ranked the Haas School 
#11 among global MBA programs offered in the US and Europe in its Sept. 13 
issue.

The top universities offering global MBAs were:
1. Harvard University
2. U. Pennsylvania (Wharton)
3. Stanford University
4. MIT (Sloan)
5. Northwestern (Kellogg)
6. INSEAD (tied)
6. London Business School (tied)
7. University of Chicago
8. Columbia University
9. UCLA (Anderson)
10. University of Texas-Austin
11. UC Berkeley (Haas)
12. Duke University (Fuqua)
13. New York University (Stern)
14. University of Michigan
15. University of Virginia (Darden)

The rankings issue of America Economia examined the competition US and 
European business schools pose to Latin American institutions. In addition 
to its global MBA ranking, it ranked Latin American business schools in a 
separate ranking.

Sue and Jeff --

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.

Have you guys talked about this at all?  I think it would be really fun and
not expensive (given the frequent flier miles).  Let me know...

Dear Cameron,
I'm so sorry for answering only today but i received a virus from an e-mail
and only from yestarday i can work with my computer! I don't know if are
still interested but we have available two double rooms with a.c. & t.v. for
the period that you request. Rate is $ 60.00 (plus 16% sales taxes), per
room/per night, and include airport transfers.
About the sand fleas, the situation is like the other place in the tropical
area. I always suggest to my Customers to put on the skin oil for the beach
and repellent spray for the night, but is not a big problem.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards
Adriana Astorina

Also if you could tell me a little about the sand fleas, I would appreciate
it.

Jeff,

We're still here, just to let you know.

Have been working on a small project which has evolved into something
quite larger as the owners keep adding more. We still plan on doing your
project, but I can't leave the current one until finished.

I will stay in touch.

'New' Napster growth 'astounding'

Consumers transferred 1.81 billion digital media files using the 
Kazaa, MusicCity and Grokster file-sharing applications during 
October, according to industry analysts at Webnoize. Each of the 
Web sites uses software licensed from FastTrack, a technology 
company based in Amsterdam. By contrast, an estimated 1.57 
million people were using Napster simultaneously in February, 
while the FastTrack network clocked in last month with 1.3 
million. ""During the last four months the number of users 
typically logged on has risen by 480%, and in November will 
likely surpass Napster at its peak,"" said Webnoize senior 
analyst Matt Bailey. ""The growth of the FastTrack network 
continues to be astounding.""

Aerie to revive Ricochet

Aerie Networks will restart the bankrupt Ricochet wireless 
broadband service, but it didn't say when. Denver-based Aerie 
announced Monday that it agreed to buy the assets of Metricom 
Inc. for $8.25 million -- a mere fraction of the system's $1 
billion cost. Before Metricom's financial demise, Ricochet 
provided wireless data coverage in 17 cities and had 51,000 
subscribers, according to Aerie president Mort Aaronson. ""In 
order to bring it back, we will create partnerships to provide 
the service at a new lower price point than previously offered 
and make it available to millions of users where they buy other 
related products and services,"" Aaronson said.

Yahoo goes traditional for marketer

Yahoo Inc.  announced the hiring of a 54-year-old ""old economy"" 
executive to be its chief global marketing officer. John 
Costello, most recently executive vice president of sporting 
goods etailer MVP.com, has also worked in marketing with Sears 
Roebuck & Co., Procter & Gamble, and Pepsi-Cola USA. ""John is an 
exceptional marketing executive with the depth and breadth of 
experience necessary to lead Yahoo's global marketing team,"" 
said Greg Coleman, the Net giant's executive vice president of 
North American operations, in a statement.

STOCKS ATTEMPTING TO RECAPTURE EARLY LOSSES

Mostly gloomy corporate news, including an ominous earnings 
report and outlook from Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM,54,f1), was offset 
by better-than-expected productivity gains in 3Q as stocks 
recovered from this morning's lows to trade mixed at midday.

As of 11:52 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 
0.1%, while the Nasdaq was 0.5% higher. The S&P 500 Index was 
down 0.1%. Homebuilding, networking and consumer finance stocks 
were among the best performers, while energy-related, retail and 
health care issues led the decliners.

Shares of Qualcomm Inc. were lower after the wireless 
communication company posted 4Q earnings, excluding items, of 
$0.23 per share, lower than the First Call consensus estimate of 
$0.25 per share, due to slumping global demand and missed 
interest payments from Mexican wireless company Pegaso PCS. 
Qualcomm also lowered its fiscal 2002 guidance, saying that most 
of the growth won't come until the second half, and the company 
expects pro forma earnings in 1Q in the range of $0.21-$0.24 per 
share, below the Street's previous $0.27 per share mean 
forecast.

Shares of Aetna Inc. (AET,30,f2) were under pressure, even 
though the largest U.S. health insurer said it incurred a 3Q 
loss, excluding items, of $0.34 per share, ahead of the Street's 
$0.55 per share loss estimate. Revenues declined roughly 8% to 
$6.2 billion as the company blamed rising health care costs and 
underpriced insurance plans for its woes. Chief Executive John 
Rowe said, ""We continue to experience high medical costs, which 
are causing us to fall short of our ultimate goals.""

The stock of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. (MXIM,53,f1) took a 
hit after the semiconductor manufacturer said fiscal 1Q profits 
fell 49% to $0.17 a share, $0.01 ahead of the Street's mean 
forecast. Maxim blamed sluggish demand for semiconductors amid a 
weakening economy, as sales for the period fell 43% to $239.4 
million. Going forward, company executives said fiscal 2Q 
profits and sales will rise only slightly above 1Q figures.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds generally rose following this morning's productivity 
report that suggested a non-inflationary environment, but 
profit-taking hit the short-end following yesterday's rise after 
the Federal Open Market Committee interest-rate cut and 
accompanying statement, which hinted at more easing. According 
to the Labor Department, 3Q non-farm productivity rose at an 
annualized pace of 2.7%, ahead of analysts' forecasts per Dow 
Jones Newswires of a 2.1% gain. Unit labor costs rose 1.8%, less 
than Bloomberg's 2.4% forecast. Real hourly compensation rose at 
a 3.8% annual rate. The Labor Department said the productivity 
gains and slower pace of the labor cost increase could be 
attributed to a 3.6% reduction in the number of hours worked 
during the quarter, partly because of the tragic Sept. 11 
attacks.

In other news, wholesale inventories declined 0.1% in September 
from August's revised 0.2% drop, according to the Commerce 
Department. Bloomberg analysts were expecting a 0.3% drop. 
Wholesale sales fell 1.3% after August's 0.5% rise. As a result, 
the inventory-to-sales ratio, a key measure of how many months 
it would take to deplete current inventory, rose to 1.32 from 
August's 1.30.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets were higher late in the session amid heightened 
expectations for a rate cut by the European Central Bank 
following this morning's weak economic data. The business 
climate indicator for the euro-zone fell to -1.14 in October 
from September's -0.57, while German factory orders fell a 
worse-than-expected 4.1% in September from August's revised 0.8% 
rise, it's biggest drop in six years. Bundesbank President Ernst 
Weltke attempted to mollify trader's fears by saying that 
""Sentiment is worse than the actual situation"" and that the 
economic malaise is temporary. The dollar recouped some of its 
losses upon the release of the better-than-expected productivity 
numbers but remained lower against the euro. The Bloomberg 
European 500 Index was up 0.74% as of 11:52 a.m. EST on strength 
in chemical and manufacturing stocks.

For those of you interested in Entrepreneurship or Biotech/Healthcare,
they're doing some cool stuff at UCSF. 

There's an e-mail list, plus several speaker/networking events. Sam
Collela of Versant Vertures spoke at their first event two weeks ago.
Our very own Peter Fiske will speak at an event on Dec 5th.

The organizers specifically asked that Evening MBA students were invited
to participate (our fame precedes us). Great opportunity to meet up with
clinicians/scientists with new ideas who need help with commercialization.

See below for details.

Hello ,

We have an exciting new program here at UCSF called the UCSF Innovation Accelerator
(UCSF-IA), whose mission is to engage and educate the UCSF community in
entrepreneurial ventures.  This year UCSF-IA is hosting a number of
activities including:
an Entrepreneur's Discussion Group, three workshops: Opportunity
Recognition in Life
Sciences, Writing a Winning Executive Summary, and Intellectual Property
in Life
Sciences (two will be mixers with the Biotech Club of Berkeley's Haas
School of
Business), and an Executive Summary Competition with an Awards Ceremony.

These activities aim to provide a forum for UCSF
students/postdocs/clinicians/scientists to
learn about the biotech business and writing business plans, to
encourage interest in
entrepreneurship, and to network with Bay Area scientists and business
professionals and MBAs.

We encourage you to sign-up on our listserv: ucsf-ia to receive
up-to-date information and

Mr. Showbiz takes retirement

Mr. Showbiz, an entertainment news and features Web site, has 
ended its six-year run, as owner Walt Disney Co. shuttered the 
service. The expected closure of the site occurred as Disney 
made more cuts in its Internet staffing. While the company did 
not release details, message boards on the Web indicated 26 
people were laid off at ABCNews.com and 125 at the Disney 
Internet Group. Visitors to Mr. Showbiz.com are now being 
redirected to ABCNews.com.

WebSideStory Inc. The company develops software to improve Web 
site operations and enable WebSideStory to collect information 
about Web users' activities. ""If the past is any indication, 
Windows XP will be the dominant OS on the Web by this time next

Sign-ups slow for online gift registries

Only 7% of online buyers have created an online registry or wish 
list for the holiday shopping season, according to researcher 
Jupiter Media Metrix. ""Registry users are ripe prospects for 
retailers,"" said analyst Rob Leathern. Retailers must give 
consumers the ability to access registries in a physical 
location as well as online,"" he said. ""Retailers will benefit 
from higher sales, with little additional customer acquisition 
efforts.""

CMTA ADVOCATES FOR EQUIPMENT SALES TAX EXEMPTION

CMTA President Jack Stewart and member company Baxter Healthcare
Corporation will testify on November 8 before the Assembly Committee on
Jobs, Economic Development and the Economy and explain why an equipment
sales tax exemption is needed by manufacturers and how its enactment
would stimulate job growth in California.  Chairwoman Sarah Reyes
(D-Fresno) conducted a similar hearing last month in Silicon Valley at
which this proposal was offered by high tech representatives.  As a
result, she invited CMTA to speak on this proposal further and to more
fully describe how the sales tax exemption would help get California's
economy back to health.

CMTA believes that manufacturing and technology strength is essential to
a strong California economy.  Historically, our state has been a world
leader in these industries which include electronics, biotechnology,
aerospace, and the production of goods of every description.  A strong
manufacturing base brings high paying jobs and produces an enormous
positive ripple effect in the state's economy.   In order to stay in
business, manufacturing companies must make enormous investments in
capital equipment on a continuing basis.  California taxes the purchases
of manufacturing equipment while 46 states do not.  Many of the 46 also
provide tax credits to entice manufacturing expansion to their states.
While existing MIC (California's Manufacturers Investment Tax Credit)
law provides some companies a partial offset against sales tax
liability, California's tax burden in this regard is one of the worst
four in the country and much heavier than that of any other industrial
state.  Such an exemption would greatly enhance California's
attractiveness as a choice for building a new facility or expanding an
existing site.  It would bring a direct and immediate incentive for
expansion to all companies in all parts of the state in the
manufacturing sector.

CMTA will also give testimony on its proposed moratorium on regulatory
fees and its measure to reduce electricity rates and provide customer
choice in energy.


ENERGY POLICIES REVISITED

As the energy crisis wanes, many of the actions taken in the last year
are being revisited.  Here's a sampling of what was done, why
policy-makers are taking a second-look, and what may result:

   * In January ABX1 1 (Keeley D-Boulder Creek) directed DWR to purchase
     electricity, and DWR signed long term contracts at the height of
     the crisis.  High fixed prices and reliance on natural gas-fired
     generation have caused consumers, environmentalists and the CPUC to
     demand renegotiation. Contract modification could lower prices and
     make more room for direct access contracts between customers and
     suppliers.
   * ABX1 1 also prescribed a financing mechanism that upon second-look
     the legislature wants modified by SBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco),
     which uncouples payment for DWR contracts from payment of bonds.
     Citing a preference for SBX2 18 and renegotiation of DWR contracts,
     the CPUC refused to approve a rate agreement so that bonds can be
     issued.   The Governor promises to veto SBX2 18, but has started
     reviewing DWR contracts.
   * The Power Authority was created to ensure a 15% reserve margin in
     electricity supplies. This spring it issued an RFP for supply, but
     was informed recently by DWR that no additional long term supply is
     required. Assemblyman Keeley will hold a hearing this month to
     review the mission and activities of the Power Authority.
   * Last year the legislature passed a bill requiring all generators
     sited under expedited 4 month licensing to switch from simple cycle
     to cleaner combined-cycle within 3 years.  On November 5th, under
     the Governor's emergency powers, the CEC removed this requirement,
     allowing the Power Authority to fulfill it's 15% margin with
     dirtier plants for an indefinite term. Environmentalists claim that
     this means dirtier plants for 30 years.
   * As the energy crisis became headline news, the ISO 27 member
     stakeholder board came under attack as an ineffective,
     generator-driven body. Replaced this year with a 5 member board
     appointed by the Governor, the new ISO and DWR are now under attack
     for sharing information and manipulating the wholesale market in
     violation of federal law.
   * In June the CPUC ordered the largest rate increase in history.
     Since wholesale prices declined this summer, PG&E and SCE are
     collecting more revenues than needed to cover current utility and
     DWR costs.  If this trend continues, rates may be adjusted
     downward, or revenues may be allocated to historical costs, such as
     utility and DWR back debt.
   * In September both PG&E and SCE submitted plans for payment of back
     debt. PG&E is waiting for bankruptcy court approval of the asset
     transfer to its holding company, and SCE is fighting for it's rate
     freeze deal on appeal from federal district court. Legislators may
     review the plans upon their return in January.

A LOOK BACK AT THE INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM

It was almost a year ago that blackouts plagued California, and
businesses that operated under interruptible contracts felt the squeeze
of repeated curtailments.  Dire predictions that the Summer of 2001
would be fraught with blackouts never came to pass, and a year later,
the State continues to evaluate its energy infrastructure, supply and
demand.

Still at issue is whether or not those businesses that did not opt-out
of interruptible programs will be required to repay the fines and
penalties that accrued between October 2000 and January 25, 2001.

Numerous requests to curtail, the threat of hundreds of thousands of
dollars in fines and penalties, and suspension of the opt-out window in
November 2000, led to demands by the business community for the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act to remedy the
situation.  As a result, in January the CPUC suspended fines and
penalties for failure to curtail under interruptible contracts and the
programs temporarily were placed on hold.

In April, the CPUC issued Rulemaking 00-10-002 which, among other
things, allowed businesses to opt-out or readjust their firm service
level effective November 1, 2000 if they repaid the discounts received
from November 1, 2000 through April 25, 2001.  These customers were not
required to pay fines or penalties that accrued between those dates,
however, they were prohibited from participating in any load reduction
program that pays per kW for the remainder of 2001.

Customers also were allowed to opt-out or to adjust their firm service
level effective the beginning of the first billing period after approval
of this rulemaking and upon notification by the utility.  These
customers were allowed to retain the rate discount for interruptible
service through the date of any change in schedule or firm service
level, but were required to pay any fines or penalties assessed for
failure to interrupt during the period that fines and penalties were not
suspended.

The CPUC has wrestled with how to address the substantial fines and
penalties assessed on businesses, and yet still preserve the program
such that businesses would comply when called upon in the future.

No CPUC solution would have made whole all businesses that participated
in the program, and as expected, the CPUC decision affected each
business differently.  It is rumored that the CPUC will revisit the
fines and penalties provisions to see how businesses that substantially
curtailed, but were required to repay the full discount were impacted,
however, a specific hearing date has not yet been set.  Stay tuned for
further developments.


SLOWING ECONOMY HAMMERS BAY AREA WORKERS
Technology Sector Drives Job Losses

According to a just released report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, the economic downturn has resulted in 30,000 lost Bay Area
jobs in just the last five months. The breadth of the slowdown in the
information technology (IT) sector has seriously begun to drag down
employment in other sectors. The Bay Area relies on high-tech for 32
percent of its wages and 11 percent of its jobs.

Business investment in IT products and software has slowed substantially
this year, dampened by uncertainty in the national economy, dot-com and
telecommunications crash, and over investment by business in IT
products. The abrupt slowdown in business investment in IT has had a
noticeable impact on orders, shipments, and production among technology
firms, resulting in declines in output and employment in these sectors,
according to the report.

Softening markets for new office and industrial space have also dampened
growth in construction employment this year. Employment among providers
of shipping, trucking, and warehousing services also fell in recent
months, as firms scaled back in response to slowing demand.


BILL PROHIBITING ""ENGLISH-ONLY"" RULE MAY HINDER WORKPLACE SAFETY

The California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA) opposed AB
800, a bill authored by Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and
signed by Governor Davis.  The bill makes it an unlawful employment
practice for an employer to limit or prohibit the use of non-English
language in the workplace unless justified by an overriding business
necessity.

The Fair Employment and Housing Act already prohibits an ""English-only""
rule with one exception.  An employer can require that employees speak
only in English at certain times if the employer can show that the rule
is justified by business necessity, and has effectively notified its
employees of the circumstances and the time when speaking only in
English is required, and the employees have been made aware of the
consequences of violating the rule.

AB 800 not only provides the same protections; it goes into greater
detail that is difficult for an employer to follow and it creates a trap
for the unwary employer.  An employer may be sued if any step outlined
in the bill is not followed exactly and could face both compensatory and
punitive damages, plus a $5000 per worker statutory damage award. No
empirical evidence was presented indicating that current law was
ineffective or that multiple monetary penalties were needed to deter
employers from violating this provision of the law.

The bill may prove harmful to employees if it turns out that injuries or
fatalities in the workplace begin occurring because safety and health
rules are not being clearly communicated and understood by all employees
and reinforced in a common language.  CMTA is also concerned that the
bill may encourage more discrimination and harassment complaints by
employees who believe they are the subjects of non-English conversations
that could severely undermine employee moral.

AB 800 becomes law on January 1, 2002.  Employers who have
""English-only"" rules should review their rules to make sure that they
are not in conflict with the bill.

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Babies?  Hardly.  Retired just sounds better than unemployed.  My
standard answer is that I'm the model of domesticity, fitness and
volunteerism.  However, Teddy says I can't claim ""Model of Fitness""
until I'm actually pictured in a magazine.

ALJ Pulsifer  --  Pursuant to your instructions at today's PHC, this is to
inform you and the parties that CLECA will file a Motion to Strike portions
of the testimony of TURN witness Marcus and PG&E witness Kuga that address
the creation of specific fees or charges on direct access customers.  That
issue is specifically before Comm. Wood and ALJ Barnett in A.98-07-003 and
it is not appropriately part of the inter-utility allocation of DWR costs

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Summary:
1. IPPs Rise 3.8%   Last week our IPP composite rose 3.8%, outperforming the
S&P 500 (+3.0%), but underperforming the NASDAQ (+4.7%).  Mirant, which was
up 12.9%, was the strongest generator in the group.  International Power was
the weakest performer, declining 2.4%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Rise 5.5%   Our universe of generation
oriented utilities rose 5.5%, outperforming all major indices including the
UTY (4.0%).  Constellation Energy, which was up 8.6%, was the strongest
performer in the group.  Cleco Corp was the weakest performer, improving
3.4%.

3. DYN/ENE Deal Removes Overhang   We attribute last week's strong
performance to indications of an imminent resolution to Enron's financial
difficulties in the form of an investment from Dynegy.  Late on Friday,
these reports proved true with Dynegy agreeing to acquire Enron and provide
immediate liquidity support.  Over the last few weeks, the group came under
pressure owing to concerns about Enron's deteriorating credit quality.  In
particular, IPP investors were concerned about the level of receivables
exposure of various companies to Enron.  Further, some industry observers
suggested that a damaging reduction in trading liquidity could result if
Enron were forced to withdraw from the natural gas and power markets.  

4. New Feature: Regional Spark Spread Analysis   Inside we include a
regional spark spread analysis looking back 2 years.  Going forward, this
analysis will be a regular feature in the Weekly.

5. Valuations Remain Attractive; Focus On the Major IPPs: Highlighting CPN,
MIR and NRG   Given diminishing Enron concerns, we would expect investors to
refocus on attractive valuations across the sector.  The pure play power
producers are trading at a 12% average discount to their private market
asset values.   We continue to highlight Calpine, Mirant and NRG Energy.  

6. MIR Hosting Analyst Seminar   On Tuesday (11/13), Mirant will host its
second major analyst meeting in Atlanta, Georgia.  We expect management to
discuss the following: 1. Business plan update; 2. 2002 earnings visibility;
3. Financing plans; and 4. Reaction to DYN/ENE deal.

7. CSFB Philippines Energy Forum; Relevant to MIR   On 11/15 at 3.30 pm CSFB
will host a Philippines Energy Forum at the Waldorf Hotel in NYC.  The
meeting will feature 3 speakers: 1. Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,
The President of the Philippines; 2. the Honorable Vincent S. Perez, Jr.,
Secretary of the Department of Energy of the Philippines; and, 3. Rick
Kuester, CEO of Mirant Asia Pacific.  The forum will focus on upcoming
developments and opportunities in the power and oil/gas industry in the
Philippines.

ALJ Pulsifer  --  Pursuant to your instructions at today's PHC, this is
to
inform you and the parties that CLECA will file a Motion to Strike
portions
of the testimony of TURN witness Marcus and PG&E witness Kuga that
address
the creation of specific fees or charges on direct access customers.
That
issue is specifically before Comm. Wood and ALJ Barnett in A.98-07-003
and
it is not appropriately part of the inter-utility allocation of DWR
costs
that is the subject of this proceeding.  I believe that other customer
groups will join CLECA in that filing, which we plan to make on Tuesday
when
the Commission opens for business.  William Booth

      reader<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, MBA graduates commanded huge starting packages as companies 
      vied to recruit them. In the current economic environment, their prospects 
      have changed dramatically. With extensive layoffs at dotcoms and with other 
      companies cutting back in the face of falling sales and profits, many graduates 
      of MBA programmes have found themselves struggling to find jobs. <br>
      <br>
      A new report, <a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34013_6617738_2_80010922_60368779_1_52"">MBA Outlook</a>, from The Economist Global Executive looks at the prospects 
      for MBAs today. It provides insight into whether now is the time to take 
      an MBA and it advises on how to position yourself for the job market if 
      you already have or are studying for your MBA. <br>
      <br>
      This special report includes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>The MBA, changing and static: What does business education offer in 
          the face of an economic downturn? 
        <li>Back to business school: A gamble that more people want to take <!-- change: editorial fix --> 
        <li>An interview with Henry Mintzberg: What's wrong with business education 
          today? 
        <li>Whitehead Mann's advice on how to use your MBA to get a job in investment 
          banking 
        <li>The MBA in Europe: How European programmes are seeking to distinguish 
          themselves 
        <li>The dropouts return: CFO Magazine reports on the former dotcom hopefuls 
          who are now finishing their studies 
        <li>How a leading business school is coping with the economic downturn 
        <li>How distance learning is making the MBA world smaller
      </ul>MBA Outlook is sponsored by a number of <a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34014_6617738_2_80010922_60368779_1_53"">business schools</a>. They have provided comprehensive intelligence on their programmes 
      giving you the information you need to make an informed choice. They tell 
      you what, in their view, sets them apart, what courses they offer and what 
      makes a successful applicant to their school. They advise applicants from 
      outside the US and provide important statistics on their programmes as well 
      as details of their career services and their alumni. Find these profiles 
      here.<br>

      In an uncertain economy, find out what rewards&#151;and risks&#151;come 
      from pursuing an MBA degree. Research the effect of the downturn on MBA 
      programmes and graduates. Learn what MBAs can do to position themselves 
      best. Read

Hey Jeff -=20
Thanks for getting the word out there, and hi to everyone checking in. So h=
ere's the deal, I want to build a DAW (digital audio workstation) - a compu=
ter for multi-track audio recording and mixing etc... I've been researching=
 this for a while but have just gotten more serious about it in the last co=
uple of weeks, partly because I lucked into a nice piece of hardware (indef=
inate loan from a friend). An 8 to 10 channel interface called a Delta 1010=
 which gives me a nice head start.=20
    From what I have read so far, it seems that  there are some specific re=
quirements for a machine to be solid and reliable. It needs to be fast (not=
 so hard these days, but the faster the better within my budget). It needs =
to be paired down - anything running in the background like power-managemen=
t schemes can cause pops and clicks while you're recording and extraneous h=
areware uses system resources. And it should have a seperate, fast and larg=
e hard drive just for the audio data (typically a SCSI drive). I'm finding =
 a lot of recomendations against buying something off the shelf like a Dell=
 or whatever. Mostly, I think, to have more control over the specific compo=
nents and also to cut down on a lot of the unnecessary (to audio recording)=
 integrated accessories that those computers tend to have. Also, I'm kind o=
f looking forward to building it myself. I like that kind of thing and it w=
ould mean I know how the thing works.
    Here's the plan I'm formulating at this point. I'm thinking of putting =
together a dual processor system with the fastest pentium IIIs I can afford=
. There doesn't seem to be all that big a price range between the different=
 speeds just now - probably because they're yesterday's news with the P4s o=
ut there. (By the way the Pentium 4s have not been getting the best reviews=
 in the audio world - from what I can tell - and I don't think there's a du=
al processor motherboard for them yet. Also, I think they are more expensiv=
e.) For this I need to come up with a motherboard. The one that I've come u=
p with so far is an Asus Tek CUV4X-D but I'm new to all this and I don't ev=
en know what I don't know as far as what's out there so any suggestions are=
 welcome. Also I know I need a fast SCSI (ideally, 10,000rpm or better, dat=
a trasnsfer rate of 80MB per second, sustained transfer rate of at least 24=
MB per second or better, and a seek time of 6ms or less - as quoted in one =
of my sources). Of course I need a pile of memory but I understand that it'=
s pretty cheap right now. There also seems to be a debate going on about AM=
D's CPUs these days.=20
    Hopefully I can save some money going low end on stuff like the monitor=
, the keyboard, and anything else that doesn't directly pertain to audio re=
cording because I actually am on a budget . Maybe there are some elements t=
hat I can even save for an upgrade. I am willing to spend what I need to, t=
hough, because if this works well it could make for a more affordable way t=
o record True Blue's upcoming cd than going into a regular studio.    =20
    So there you have it in a rambling kind of way. I appreciate any info y=
ou all can offer. For instance I really don't know what the cheapest source=
 for all this stuff is and there are probably plenty of issues that I'm tot=
ally ignorant of. Clearly, all this points to the old saying about a little=
 knowledge being a dangerous thing.=20

Attached for your review and comment is a first draft of the WPTF motion to intervene and protest the WestConnect filing.  The major points made in it are as follows:
 ?      The Commission should convene a technical conference to deals with areas in the WestConnect filing that require further clarification, such as congestion management.  Moreover, the analysis of congestion management issues must focus on the equitable allocation of transmission rights;

?      The Commission should require WestConnect to establish an independent board, with an accompanying stakeholder process that complies with commission precedent;

?      All load should be required to take service under the WestConnect tariff; 

?      Interconnection issues should be deferred until completion of the Commission's generic proceeding on this topic; and

?      Since a for-profit Transco has an inherent incentive to maximize transmission revenue, there are certain RTO functions that an entity such as WestConnect should not perform.

I am indebted to Karen Shea of Dynegy and Glenn Martin of Mirant for their very helpful assistance.  Our draft also draws upon concepts contained in the EPSA filing that Gary Ackerman provided.  The filing is due at FERC on Thursday the 15th.  I therefore need any comments from you no later than early that morning.  Thanks!

STOCKS MIXED IN MIDDAY ACTION

Stocks were flat to higher following a much better-than-expected 
retail sales report and some mildly positive corporate earnings 
news. Retail sales for October were higher primarily reflecting 
aggressive incentive financing at auto dealerships.

As of 11:52 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 
0.5%, while the Nasdaq was down 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index was 
unchanged. Retail stocks were among the best performers, while 
energy-related stocks led the decliners.

Computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard (HWP,22,f2) posted 
fiscal 4Q profits of $0.19 a share, well ahead of the First Call 
consensus estimate of $0.08 per share on an 18% decline in 
sales. The company cited strength in the performance of its 
imaging and services segments as well as storage and PC 
products, despite the continued soft computing environment. 
Looking ahead, HP said it sees fiscal 1Q margins and expenses to 
be flat with 4Q, with slightly lower revenues.

Network-attached storage maker Network Appliance (NTAP,15.56,f1) 
reported a fiscal 2Q profit excluding charges of $0.02 a share, 
above the Street's breakeven forecast. Including items, Network 
Appliance incurred a loss of $0.03 per share on a 25% drop in 
sales to $194.7 million. NTAP's CEO said that he expects 3Q 
revenues and earnings to be sequentially flat amid a murky 
outlook for business demand.

Shares of BEA Systems (BEAS, 16.56,f1) were nearly flat after 
the business software maker reported 3Q operating earnings of 
$0.06 per share, $0.01 higher than the First Call consensus 
estimate on a 2% decline in revenue. The company reiterated its 
4Q EPS guidance of $0.06 - $0.07 per share and said new products 
were helping to drive sales. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasuries were down, though off of lows reached in the 
wake of this morning's retail sales data as stocks backed off 
earlier highs. According to the Commerce Department, retail 
sales rose 7.1%, boosted by a record 26.4% jump in auto sales, 
amid 0% financing incentives at most of the major dealerships. 
September's sales figures were revised to a 2.2% decrease from 
the previously reported 2.4% decline. Analysts per Dow Jones 
Newswires were expecting an increase in October retail sales of 
2.5%. Excluding autos, retail sales were up 1.0%, above the 
consensus forecast for a 0.4% increase on strength in clothing 
stores and building materials sales. Consumer spending remains 
the linchpin of economic growth and the strong retail sales 
results are somewhat impressive given the backdrop of the recent 
terrorist attacks, ongoing retaliatory campaign and waning 
employment conditions.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets gave back earlier gains and headed mostly lower 
in step with U.S. equity markets. Energy, gas and insurance 
issues led the decliners, while travel, metals and manufacturing 
were among the advancers. The Bloomberg 500 index was up 0.05% 
as of 11:52 a.m. EST. BP Plc (BP, 46) was among noteworthy 
energy-related decliners as oil continued to get hammered 
following comments from OPEC ministers stating that, without the 
support of non-OPEC members (mainly Russia), production cuts 
would not effectively boost prices. The euro, after trending 
lower against the dollar this morning amid a worse-than-expected 
1.0% drop in October German retail sales, firmed to trade higher 
as traders booked profits in the greenback.

Hi Jeff,

I forwarded this to my friend who's an expert in the subject (but also a
difficult person to locate sometimes.)

I'll let you know when I get a response.

Hi everybody,
I happened on an addition to my search for info while doing a little research last night. There just might not be anything on this out there yet, but I was at Asus' website last night and it seems they have a new dual-processer motherboard out called a CUV266-DLS and I can't find anything about it anywhere. Maybe it's too new or too expensive for anyone to have bothered with up to this point but I'm snooping around so if you've heard anything...

I've found  that one of the best places to get what you want is at a travelling computer show.  There is one  that goes to Vallejo, Concord and Santa Rosa that I know  of and if you go this route I recommend that you ask other people at  the show who they think the most reliable people are.  The prices are really good and you find a lot of Asus, Intel and AMD stuff plus name brand products and software.  It's a good  idea to know the specs ahead of time so you can make  sure you're getting what you need.  Go to the website, marketpro.com to get more information if you're interested.

	Hey Jeff - 
	Thanks for getting the word out there, and hi to everyone
checking in. So here's the deal, I want to build a DAW (digital audio
workstation) - a computer for multi-track audio recording and mixing
etc... I've been researching this for a while but have just gotten more
serious about it in the last couple of weeks, partly because I lucked
into a nice piece of hardware (indefinate loan from a friend). An 8 to
10 channel interface called a Delta 1010 which gives me a nice head
start. 
	    From what I have read so far, it seems that  there are some
specific requirements for a machine to be solid and reliable. It needs
to be fast (not so hard these days, but the faster the better within my
budget). It needs to be paired down - anything running in the background
like power-management schemes can cause pops and clicks while you're
recording and extraneous hareware uses system resources. And it should
have a seperate, fast and large hard drive just for the audio data
(typically a SCSI drive). I'm finding  a lot of recomendations against
buying something off the shelf like a Dell or whatever. Mostly, I think,
to have more control over the specific components and also to cut down
on a lot of the unnecessary (to audio recording) integrated accessories
that those computers tend to have. Also, I'm kind of looking forward to
building it myself. I like that kind of thing and it would mean I know
how the thing works.
	    Here's the plan I'm formulating at this point. I'm thinking
of putting together a dual processor system with the fastest pentium
IIIs I can afford. There doesn't seem to be all that big a price range
between the different speeds just now - probably because they're
yesterday's news with the P4s out there. (By the way the Pentium 4s have
not been getting the best reviews in the audio world - from what I can
tell - and I don't think there's a dual processor motherboard for them
yet. Also, I think they are more expensive.) For this I need to come up
with a motherboard. The one that I've come up with so far is an Asus Tek
CUV4X-D but I'm new to all this and I don't even know what I don't know
as far as what's out there so any suggestions are welcome. Also I know I
need a fast SCSI (ideally, 10,000rpm or better, data trasnsfer rate of
80MB per second, sustained transfer rate of at least 24MB per second or
better, and a seek time of 6ms or less - as quoted in one of my
sources). Of course I need a pile of memory but I understand that it's
pretty cheap right now. There also seems to be a debate going on about
AMD's CPUs these days. 
	    Hopefully I can save some money going low end on stuff like
the monitor, the keyboard, and anything else that doesn't directly
pertain to audio recording because I actually am on a budget . Maybe
there are some elements that I can even save for an upgrade. I am
willing to spend what I need to, though, because if this works well it
could make for a more affordable way to record True Blue's upcoming cd
than going into a regular studio.     
	    So there you have it in a rambling kind of way. I appreciate
any info you all can offer. For instance I really don't know what the
cheapest source for all this stuff is and there are probably plenty of
issues that I'm totally ignorant of. Clearly, all this points to the old
saying about a little knowledge being a dangerous thing.

Subject: Meeting w/PG&E this Friday, Right after DJ's Meeting


Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the
PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've
helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and
Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are
organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a ""reasonable""
deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be
submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many
costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time
determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3)
PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for
a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less
productive ify ou're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that
permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the
Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
Jeff

Hi Evening MBA students,

This is a reminder to all 2nd-year students that your first round of 
bidding is now through noon on Friday, November 16.

To check on availability as of last night, after the 3rd years bid, just 
click on ""bidding enrollment summary"", or
http://web.haas.berkeley.edu/Registrar/info/prereg/pre-regstatus.rtf
You must be logged in to see the link or view the file.

Some courses did not show up on the attachment I sent to you last night 
because no students had enrolled in them yet.  They are available (E233, 
E239, E278.1, E278.3, E296.2).

If you have any questions please give us a call at 510-642-1406.

I think we missed each other.  I want to delay, move slowly, because in my
view that gives us a better argument that there was no notice for exit fees.
I also think we may be better off litigating the question under ABX1.  Can't
recall which section now, but the deal provides that the relationship is
between CDWR and the end user.  And the end user has a legal obligation to
pay for it upon ""DELIVERY"".  If it's never delivered, the law does not
impose an obligation.  And, I would argue, if the legislature had wanted to
impose and exit fee that was in conflict with the clear terms of the bill,
they could have.  Now, that may not hold water in next session, but at least
it makes sure Sacramento picks up the issue.
 
Let's discuss if this isn't clear.  I just don't want to rush to a ""deal.""
 
Best regards,
 
Evie

Announcement for E283-1: Real Estate Finance:

Hi All,
   The Rockefeller spreadsheet is now on izio.  I would also like to revise the wording of the swap agreement that is in the case. The new version is now on izio.
I have added the following footnote to the case:

  The Swap contract serves as an inverse floater to the floating rate bonds.  If there is a swap contract, then the A-2FL and the B-FL pay as floating rate notes, to the bond holder, with coupons of LIBOR +.36% and LIBOR + .48% per annum respectively.  Since the underlying collateral is fixed, there  has to be a cap on the payments on these floating rate notes and these caps would be 6.4449% and 6.5710% respectively.  Alternatively,  there has to be another position, an inverse floater, such that the sum of the two positions pays out the capped coupon as its maximum.  In this case Goldman Sachs achieves this using a SWAP contract.  The contract is written such that the Trust pay out the two floating rate coupons to the bond holders and also pays the difference between the floating rate coupon and the respective cap to the Swap Counterparty if the floaters are below the caps.  If the floating contract rates are above the cap, then the Swap Counterparty pays the trust the diff!
erence.  In this way the pool only pays out 6.4449% and 6.5710% on the two positions.  There will always be sufficient cash flow to cover those positions.

Jeff and Sue:

The Governor proposed the following energy-related budget cuts today:

Biomass Grant Program - Revert $5.5 million of the $11.5 million budget back
to the General Fund.  The program provides grants to operators of biomass
plants to offset loses.

Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Fund - Revert $29.9 million back to the
General Fund.  The program would have required the Trade and Commerce Agency
to guarantee loans made by financial institutions to eligible businesses for
the permitting, manufacturing, acquisition, construction, or installation of
renewable energy systems that are intended to decrease demand on the grid.

Powerwalk Program - Revert $3.2 million of the $20 million budget back to
the General Fund.  The program requires the Conservation Corps to distribute
energy efficiency information and light bulbs in low income communities.

Agricultural Peak Demand - Revert $29.4 million of the $86.3 million budget
back to the General Fund.  The program requires the state to provide grants
to the agriculture industry to install energy efficient hardware.

Expedited Siting Applications - Revert $3 million back to the General Fund.
The program would have aided local governments by enabling them to hire
additional consultants to review siting applications.

Power Plant Construction Bonuses - Revert $14 million of the $20 million
budget back to the General Fund.  The program provided bonuses to power
plant owners who got their plants on-line within a specified time period.

Renewable Energy Program - Revert $24.9 million of the $25 million budget
back to the General Fund.  The program would have required the state to
establish a renewable energy program to provide financial assistance to
public power entities, independent generators, utilities, or businesses
manufacturing renewable energy generation components or systems, or both, to
generate new and renewable energy sources.

Oil and Natural Gas Pumping - Revert $9.6 million back to the General Fund.
The program would have provided for energy efficiency audits of various oil
and natural gas facilities.

PLENTY OF ENERGY, BUT LITTLE TRUST

As state and federal officials try to rebuild the defunct California
energy market, the lack of supply has been replaced by a lack of trust
as an ingredient in the ongoing crisis.  For example:

In-state generators don't trust the ISO.  They've alleged that the ISO
(whose board is now all Governor Davis appointees) is buying power from
DWR or the Pacific Northwest rather than the cheapest bid from
generators in violation of federal law. Cal-ISO noted that DWR?s
so-called ""out of market"" purchases were more expensive than the bids to
the ISO January through August. Now the price is roughly the same.

Consumer groups don't trust the DWR. They suggest that the DWR is
manipulating the Cal-ISO market for last-minute electricity to help hide
surplus electricity that DWR agreed to buy under $43 billion worth of
long-term power contracts signed last spring. DWR denies this.

Western states don't trust California. As FERC attempts to drum up
support for a west-wide regional transmission system (RTO), they heard
from other states loud and clear ? ?Please don't screw it up ? We're all
saying we don't want to be with California ? Don't lump us all
together.? This has led FERC Commissioners to conclude that three
sub-regional organizations (one being Cal-ISO) could form under an
umbrella organization, rather than a single entity.

Consumer groups don't trust the CPUC.  The stealth deal struck by the
CPUC to bail-out Southern California Edison caused The Utility Reform
Network to ask the federal court to undo the deal. (CMTA was denied
intervention.)

Legislators don't trust FERC. The bankruptcy reorganization plan for
PG&E sends generation assets to the holding company, and FERC has
jurisdiction over the power sale contract back to the regulated utility.
Many legislators blame FERC for the market melt-down last year and
object to any more FERC control over California markets.

Consumers don't trust the California Power Authority and DWR.  The
California Power Authority was created to ensure a 15% reserve margin in
electricity supplies as insurance against blackouts and price spikes.
DWR entered into $43 billion in long term contracts, and is one of the
largest single buyers of electricity in the entire West.  The
combination of current long-term DWR contracts and the possibility of
more investment in supply by the CPA has consumer groups worrying that
lower prices are only a distant and faint hope.


CPUC'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY FUNDING

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a draft
decision this week on future energy efficiency policies in an effort to
open energy efficiency funding to non-utility entities and to create
competition with investor-owned utility programs.

Specifically, the decision opens public goods charge energy efficiency
funding to non-utility entities such as local governments, chambers of
commerce and others interested in participating in the program.  The
CPUC believes that this competition will spur overall program delivery
improvement and encourage program continuity by creating multi-year
funding opportunities.

The policy manual to be adopted defines CPUC policy rules in great
detail and is intended to assist interested parties in preparing
proposals in a standard format, to minimize ?apples and oranges?
comparisons.

$160 million will be provided to fund statewide programs; $70 million in
grants will be made available to fund innovative local and regional
programs; and, $6 million will be allocated to the CPUC to assess the
State's energy efficiency needs.

Following, in order of importance, are the goals and objectives of the
CPUC?s energy efficiency programs.  The point value under each objective
represents their maximum possible score for each objective.  A perfect
score would be 100 points.

     1).  Long-Term Annual Gas and Electric Savings
     25 Points
     The purpose of this category is to create permanent and
     verifiable energy savings over the life-cycle of energy
     efficiency measures affected by the program.  In this area,
     the CPUC is striving for sustainability in the consumption
     behaviors and investment choices its programs are designed to
     stimulate.

     2). Addressing Market Failures or Barriers
     20 Points
     The proposal must include a description of the type of barrier
     it is designed to overcome.  (For example, lack of consumer
     information about energy efficiency benefits; higher start-up
     expense for high-efficiency measures relative to
     standard-efficiency measures; lack of availability of
     high-efficiency products.)

     3). Equity Considerations
     17 Points
     The CPUC will generally prioritize programs that provide
     access to energy efficiency alternatives for under-served or
     hard-to-reach markets.

     4). Cost Effectiveness
     15 Points
     All proposals will be required to provide an estimate of the
     life-cycle benefits and costs.

     5). Electric Peak Demand Savings
     10 Points
     Programs paid for by electric public goods charge funds should
     emphasize long-term and permanent peak demand savings.

     6). Innovation
     8 Points
     The CPUC will prioritize programs that present new ideas, new
     delivery mechanisms, new providers of energy efficiency
     services, or new and emerging technologies.

     7). Synergies and Coordination with Programs Run by Other
     Entities
     5 Points
     To minimize confusion and overlap for consumers, the CPUC
     desires program proposals that take advantage of synergies or
     coordination with other existing programs, including those run
     by other state agencies, private entities, municipal
     utilities, or the federal government.

The program allows non-utility parties to submit proposals directly to
the Commission for consideration, rather than to the utilities, as has
been required in the past.  Existing 2001 programs will be continued in
the First Quarter of 2002, for a smooth transition, and most new
programs will run through 2003.

For more information see the CPUC?s website, http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/,
email them at ee@cpuc.ca.gov or call the energy efficiency hotline at
(415) 703-2776.   The CPUC plans to hold a public workshop to assist
parties in preparing proposals, once the decision is finalized.


EMPLOYERS MAY FACE RETROACTIVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PAYMENTS

Following newspaper articles criticizing Governor Davis and the
Employment Development Department (EDD) for making misleading remarks
regarding SB 40's (Alarcon D-Sylmar) increase in unemployment benefits
payments for laid off workers, one legislator has already initiated the
process to remedy the situation at employers' expense.  Assemblyman Lou
Papan, (D-Millbrae) introduced a preprint of AB 1 that would
retroactively increase UI benefits payments from $230 to $330 for
workers laid off on or after July 1, 2001.

This year, the Governor signed SB 40, a bill that raises the maximum
weekly payment from $230 to $300 for claims filed on and after January
1, 2002.  The squabble is about remarks made by the Governor during the
bill's signing in Los Angeles where many airline workers had been laid
off.  The Governor said ""I want to make sure we have unemployment
benefits that allow these workers to survive until the economy
recovers,"" and ""this will significantly strengthen the safety net not
only for airline employees, but high-tech workers and all those who have
been temporarily laid off as a result of a softening economy.""
Apparently, many workers believed that they would be receiving the
increase benefit payment now and were surprised when EDD later informed
them that the benefit increase would only apply to claims filed after
December 31, 2001.

CMTA has already expressed serious concern about the high cost of SB 40
to employers ($4.5 billion) and it's potential to bankrupt the UI fund.
However, if the Legislature passes a bill making benefits retroactive to
July 1, 2001 and the unemployment rate continues to grow at the current
pace, the fund will become insolvent even sooner than our earlier
prediction.  While no one knows what the cost of six months of
retroactive UI benefits payment would be to employers at this time, we
know that it would be rather substantial.

The state jobless rates rose from 5.4 percent in September to 5.7
percent in October and there are no signs indicating that the downturn
in the economy is slowing.  As many businesses struggle to survive in
these economically hard times, it seems inappropriate for government to
be contemplating adding more cost on businesses.


CARB RELEASES DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GUIDELINES

Earlier this week, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) issued for
public review the latest iteration of its environmental justice guidance
document, entitled ?Proposed Policies and Actions for Environmental
Justice?.  This effort has been a source of concern for CMTA and others
in the business community given CARB's decision to depart from the
statutory framework established by SB 115 (Solis, 1999) and SB 89
(Escutia, 2000).  In addition, while the current version is much
improved over earlier versions, there are two remaining significant
issues.

First, California's air quality programs are based on attaining criteria
pollutant standards (e.g., ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides)
and reducing risks posed by toxic air contaminants.  ARB?s proposed
policy would change that fundamental framework by focusing on
?cumulative emissions.?  This shift in focus disregards the relevance of
exposure and risk in determining the existence and extent of a problem
and could lead to random, rather than science-based, regulatory actions.

Second, consistent with State environmental justice statutes, California
should address environmental justice on a programmatic basis as opposed
to a permit-by-permit basis.  However, references in the document to
?permitting? and ?mitigation? appear to be at odds with that approach.

These concerns have been brought to ARB?s attention by several business
organizations, along with specific suggestions for alternative language
to make the document consistent with California's existing air quality
framework.  The Board will consider adoption of the document during its
December 13 hearing.


WASTE BOARD ADOPTS STRATEGIC PLAN

On Tuesday, November 13th, the California Integrated Waste Management
Board (CIWMB) adopted its 2001 Strategic Plan on a 6-0 vote,
incorporating changes drafted by staff that address some of the concerns
raised by manufacturers and other business representatives.  Among the
noteworthy changes, new language was added to define the concept of
?zero waste? as ?striving towards maximum waste reduction through the
most efficient use of natural resources ? and maximizing recycling?.
Other language changes addressing the concepts of ?product stewardship?,
?sustainability? and ?manufacturer responsibility? help to address CMTA
concerns about the potential use of this document as a rationale for new
government mandates, such as minimum content, recycling rates and taxes
on specific products.

The full text of the adopted Plan is available at
http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/agendas/mtgdocs/2001/11/00006552.doc


HEARING ON POST ATTACK STATE OF THE ECONOMY

The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee's November 14 informational
hearing on ?The Response to Recent Terrorist Attacks? elicited testimony
from the Legislative Analyst, the California Budget Project and various
travel related industries regarding the post attack state of the economy
and appropriate legislative responses.  Testimony was also requested as
to what tax relief might be appropriate for victims? families.

According to the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), California is in a
mild recession which will give way to moderate recovery in the Spring.
On the other hand, LAO conceded ?huge? uncertainty as to when consumer
confidence would return or the stock market decline would ?play out.?
Witnesses from the California Budget Project stated that tax relief was
not the best way to boost the state's economy; the basis for their
opinion was that taxes account for a small percentage of the cost of
doing business and that the state budget accounts for a small share of
the state's economy.  They also claimed that California is not at a
competitive disadvantage.   Testimony was given by business interests
regarding the types of relief that would be appropriate now and marginal
cost reduction for a business can make the difference between bankruptcy
and survival.

CMTA presented testimony during the public comment period about the
virtue of a sales tax exemption upon manufacturing equipment: how
California  disadvantages itself by imposing such a tax and how capital
investments by manufacturers are essential to their continued role as
job providers in California.


GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL SESSION IN JANUARY ON BUDGET CUTS

Following meetings with Legislative leadership this week, Governor Davis
ordered state government to cut more than $2 billion in spending
contained in the current 2001-02 state budget. The Governor plans to
call a Special Session to run concurrently with the Legislature's
regular session in January to act on the proposed reductions.

With California reeling from its worst economic slump in a decade,
scores of programs will be slashed, diverted and delayed.  Education is
set to take the biggest hit with more than $800 million in programs that
have been the centerpiece of the Davis administration.  The expansion of
the Healthy Families program will be delayed until July 2003.  Other
cuts include $60 million for grants to encourage housing close to the
workplace, $45 million for affordable multifamily housing, $42 million
for local parks projects, $84 million in utility bill subsidies for
low-income consumers, and $120 million for energy bill assistance for
needy households.  A state government hiring freeze was already ordered
by Davis last week.

Eshoppers break out their mice

Online holiday shoppers have begun cruising the Web in earnest, 
but whether they're spending more than last year remains to be 
seen. Nielsen/NetRatings  says the volume of visitors to 
shopping sites the past week has increased vs the same period a 
year ago. ""This year's online holiday shopping season kicked off 
stronger than last year by increasing 14%, compared to 10% a 
year ago,"" said Sean Kaldor, vice president for analytical 
services.

Visits to Web sites in the toys and games category showed an 
overall 65.7% rise in the week ending Nov. 11, compared to the 
previous week. Toysrus.com  and Lego.com were the largest 
gainers. Home and garden sites had a 40.5% traffic rise and 
18.9% more people visited computer hardware sites.

Total domestic sales online topped $1 billion last week, 
according to another Web analysis firm, ComScore Networks. The 
volume was the highest since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The 
increase was driven by a rebound in travel services and other 
non-travel categories, such as apparel, indicating early 
momentum in the holiday shopping season, the company said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Web users resist paying fees

Web sites counting on generating subscription revenue face big 
challenges finding customers. The Pew Internet & American Life 
Project surveyed several thousand Web users and found that while 
17% of them said they have been asked to pay for access to a Web 
site for content, only 12% of them did so. Half said they found 
a free alternative, according to Lee Rainie, the Project's 
director. The research also found the Internet has had an impact 
on millions of Americans' lives. Twelve percent say they or 
family members have lost money investing in Internet companies, 
and 14% know someone laid off by an Internet company or firm 
that supplies services to Web companies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Credit card fraud top merchant worry

More than half the online merchants questioned in a recent 
survey say online credit card fraud is their primary concern as 
they go into the holiday season. Almost two-thirds of them are 
taking more precautions this year than last, including more 
manual checking of submitted information, according to 
Cybersource, which provides transaction services for retailers. 
Emerchants are optimistic: 54% expect their sales volume to grow 
an average of 37% this year from last.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
eBay uncorks wine sales

EBay  is offering wine for sale. Chief Executive Meg Whitman 
made the announcement during a speech at the Comdex Computer 
show in Las Vegas. ""We think it's a big market, we think it's a 
fun market,"" she said, according to CNET. The company's Web site 
includes wines, wine racks and even a complete winemaking 
facility, with set up and training. She said eBay will list 
items only from sellers licensed to distribute wine, and will 
not make sales in states where such shipments are illegal.

Where?s the opportunity for your company with the evolution of
pervasive computing? Who are the leading private company
contenders in this space? How are they managing the downturn,
and which ones look to have legs? What?s unique about their
technology and how does their value proposition sit with their
market? On December the 4 & 5, I hope you can join us to have
those questions answered. As a forum for assessing potential
clients it?ll be second-to- none. If you are still planning to
join the other leading investors and key executives, please be
sure to register at
https://secure.technologicpartners.com/pcoregister.asp today. A
key fact about the strong crop of private companies presenting
this year is that they?re the sorts of companies who helped
build the Valley in the first place, from the chipsets to the
applications that are making the vision of pervasive computing
increasingly a reality. Whether you call it pervasive, proactive
or ubiquitous computing, the best private companies that are
innovating this space will be there. Some seek partnerships now,
some later. Either way, if it?s new client opportunities you?re
looking for, the San Francisco Airport Marriott on December 4 &
5 is where you?ll find the key people building pervasive
technology companies. Take a moment to review the agenda and
companies slated to present at
http://www.pervasivecomputingoutlook.com


Building contacts with the people that matter


In this environment, establishing and building contacts in
technology sectors is still vital. As a VentureWire subscriber,
you also know that the value of the private company data and
information reported daily is unique. Pervasive Computing
Outlook provides the forum to bridge the gap ? allowing you to
make contact with the people that matter. VentureWire's data,
together with in-depth analysis and evaluation, have, I think,
ensured we've assembled a great list of CEOs who are building
companies which sell the technologies and services that will
deliver businesses and consumers the secure means to realize the
benefits of anytime, anywhere connectivity. They will be there
to tell us their stories and their plans for their companies.
There are some very interesting opportunities to be explored.
We've worked hard to collect the best out there for your review.
I hope you?ll agree. To find the companies together with their
links, goto http://www.pervasivecomputingoutlook.com/mmlist.asp




True business momentum? Proven leadership teams?


When you review the companies, you'll find they each demonstrate
specific qualities that suggest they have the best opportunity
to execute strongly. Whether it's WhereNet, whose President &
CEO, Dan Doles co-founded Red Pepper in 1993, and very recently
added Jaguar, Land Rover and Auto Alliance International, (a
Ford/Mazda joint venture) to their client list, or Matrix
Semiconductor, who have someone of the caliber of Dennis Segers
as their CEO since September, (following 2 years on their
board), we look for each participating company to exhibit true
business momentum. The goal is to cut to the chase and offer you
the most time-effective opportunity to talk to and review
worthwhile candidates.


How do you register your place?

I hope your schedule is still open for December 4 & 5. To
register your place, please take a moment to link to
www.pervasivecomputingoutlook.com and complete the online
registration form. Or, if you prefer, please call me on 212 343

Dear Haas Community,

  Sunday, November 18th, between 8:00 AM and noon, several servers will be 
shut down for a variety of  maintenance actions, including installation of 
new anti virus software. The servers affected will include the NT web 
server WEB,  the file servers HCS-DATA and HCS-DATA2, the logon profile 
server HCS-MASTER, the personal web site servers FACULTY and STUDENTS,  and 
several other non critical servers.  Most of the outages will be of short 
(30 minutes or less) duration.

  When WEB is down, web access to all NT based Web sites, including the 
EDULINK Career Services, Registration, and Admissions modules, Reserve, 
Event Center, group sites, course sites, and Helpdesk will be 
interrupted.   While FACULTY and STUDENTS  are being rebooted,  personal 
web sites will not be available.  While HCS-DATA , HCS-DATA2, and 
HCS-MASTER, are down, logon to the  Haas NT domain will be very slow, and 
roaming profiles and home directories will not be available.

Email should not be affected.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services 
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the 
Computer Center, or Helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone 
510/642-0434.  Please note that Helpdesk is not manned on 
weekends.  Requests for help logged during the weekend will be responded to 
Monday morning.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Hey Jeff - I'm still wondering if my last email made it through. Maybe you remember me saying I hit send and Outlook Express closed. The email got into my ""sent items"" but I don't see how it could have sent if the program closed so fast. Here is a copy, I don't want to just send it out and bug everyone if they already got it so I'll just bug you. Could you let me know if you already got this:

Hi everybody,
I happened on an addition to my search for info while doing a little research last night. There just might not be anything on this out there yet, but I was at Asus' website last night and it seems they have a new dual-processer motherboard out called a CUV266-DLS and I can't find anything about it anywhere. Maybe it's too new or too expensive for anyone to have bothered with up to this point but I'm snooping around so if you've heard anything...

thanks - Avram
P.S. I don't know if I remembered to tell any of you that the Kathy Kallick Band with yours truly is playing at Rancho Nicasio on Sunday. - A.", <5754960.1075859208462.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,2001-11-16 08:24:38-08:00, avramsiegel@home.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, some mail,0

STOCKS LOWER IN LACKLUSTER TRADING

U.S. equities were down marginally midday amid mixed economic 
releases and tepid earnings reports. Industrial production 
reflected continued weakness in the manufacturing sector, while 
inflation at the consumer level roughly matched expectations. 
Companies reporting earnings mostly met estimates, though 
forward guidance was cautious.

As of 11:56 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 
0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.1%. The S&P 
500 Index was down 0.4%. Financials and computer-related stocks 
paced the decliners, while communications equipment and drugs 
paced the advancers.

Shares of PC giant Dell Computer (DELL,27,f1) were lower after 
it recorded 3Q net earnings of $0.16 per share, $0.01 higher 
than the First Call consensus, on a 10% decline in revenue. The 
company reported that it captured market share from its 
competitors amid a pronounced price war as PC demand slumped. 
Amid some analysts' concerns, CEO Michael Dell said, ""the 
convergence of Windows XP, Pentium 4, low-cost broadband and 
wireless networking is creating a feature nucleus for a new 
upgrade cycle."" Going forward, Dell forecast 4Q earnings of 
$0.16 per share, in line with the Street's consensus, and said 
it saw sales rising only slightly from 3Q levels.

Electronics-testing equipment maker Agilent Technologies 
(A,24,f2) reported a fiscal 4Q loss of $0.60 per share, matching 
estimates, as demand for its equipment fell amid a slump in 
semiconductor orders and the telecommunications industry. The 
company said it expects flat sales over the next two quarters 
and a fiscal 1Q loss excluding charges of $0.40-$0.60 per share, 
versus the mean $0.49 per share loss consensus. Agilent also 
said it will eliminate another 4,000 workers and offer $1 
billion in debt.

Shares of Starbucks Corp. (SBUX,17.31,f1) were brewing lower 
after the company reported 4Q earnings of $0.14 per share, 
matching expectations, but lowered its earnings guidance for 
fiscal 2002. Citing ""an uncertain economic environment,"" the 
coffee giant stated it now anticipates full-year profits of 
$0.54-$0.55 per share, down from the $0.56-$0.58 per share 
forecast the company made in July. A number of analysts' cut 
their views on the company following the news.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds were down midday, despite a brief reprieve following this 
morning's industrial production data. In another sign of the 
weakness plaguing the industry, industrial output for October 
dropped for a 13th-consecutive month, declining 1.1%, according 
to the Federal Reserve Board, its biggest one-month drop since 
1990. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were expecting a 0.9% 
drop. Capacity utilization declined to 74.8, its lowest level 
since June 1983, from September's slightly upwardly revised 
75.7, roughly matching expectations.

In an earlier release, October consumer prices declined 0.3% 
versus the 0.2% drop forecast by Dow Jones Newswires, owing 
primarily to a huge drop in energy prices, according to the 
Labor Department. The core index, which excludes the volatile 
energy and food components, rose 0.2%, slightly more than the 
consensus forecast for a 0.1% rise. Energy prices declined 6.3%, 
the biggest drop in more than 15 years, and transportation 
prices slumped 2.2%. The relatively quiet inflation environment 
is generally bond-friendly and leaves the door open for further 
monetary easing if deemed necessary by the Fed.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets were higher later in the day, with the 
Bloomberg European 500 index up 0.63% as of 11:56 a.m. EST. 
Energy and financials paced the advancers, while mining and 
beverages drove the decliners. Much of the lift to European 
equities could be attributed to a bounce in crude oil prices off 
yesterday's 2-1/2-year lows. On the economic front, inflation in 
the euro-zone remained tame as the consumer price index matched 
expectations, declining 0.1% in October and increasing 2.4% year 
over year. The euro was higher versus the dollar amid lackluster 
U.S. equity performance and marginal gains in European bourses.

Fellow Evening Haasians,

Who are these so called account managers, Rich, Jenny and Mark? What do they do? 
How can we leverage off their expertise and they, ours? Do they have specific company
contacts? Where can they be found? Will the ubiquitous pizza be served to entice you to attend? 
Strong possibility. Will I have to sign up on Bear Tracks? No. How can attending benefit me? 
It's up to you.

To answer these questions and many more, we will be scheduling during -

Mon, Nov. 26 during the break (i.e., 7:30 - 8:15) in C125 and
Thu, Dec. 6 during the break as well in the Career Center Conference Room (S420)

an informational session with the account managers.

Here's a description that Rich Wong, the financial services account manager prepared:

""The Haas Career Center staff includes 3 account managers that
can be a valuable resource to those that are exploring job or career
direction changes. Their role is to be the primary liaison for recruiters
in their specific industry sectors, being the one-stop shop point person
for companies interested in connecting with Haas MBA students.  They
cover a full spectrum of responsibilities from the logistics of setting up
presentations and interviews to establishing contacts and providing
strategic guidance to recruiters (including both hiring managers as well
as University Recruiting reps within human resource departments).
Through this activity, they gain insights into their company/industry
focus that they are happy to share with Haas students, John Morel,
and the other career advisors in the Haas Career Center.""

Feel free to contact them regarding questions on companies and industries
that they represent.  Conversely, please provide them with any valuable
contacts that you have in current/former employers that might help them aid your
schoolmates to find employment opportunities. They are located in the Recruitment Center
(S330 by the ATM machine) and their contact information is as follows:

Mark Friedfeld - Financial Services (Investment and Commercial Banking, Real
Estate, Venture Capital)
friedfel@haas.berkeley.edu/510-642-6588

Jenny Rowe - Consulting, Consumer Products, Healthcare/Biotech/Medical

rowe@haas.berkeley.edu/510-643-4212

Rich Wong - Technology, Entertainment - rwong@haas.berkeley.edu/510-643-4211

If you plan to attend, please respond to me directly and indicate which evening.

Furthermore, by a unanimous vote of the EvMBAA, Jon Bain will be your new Career Center Liaison
starting Spr02. Many of you already have had the pleasure of interacting with Jon in your classes, as well as in John
Morel's Life-Work Balance seminars, which Jon helped organize.

Best regards, Albert Demery

Hi Jeff,

Hope you are doing well. Got your email from Scott. I'm hoping you can
do me a favor.  We are doing a  research project for a client and are
trying to identify key technical management at a variety of companies,
including Enron.

Specifically, we are looking for names and addresses of the following:

CIO/CTO
VP, Directors and/or Sr. Managers responsible for the company's
network.  They'll typically have titles like VP of Network Operations
and Senior Network Architect.

Any chance you can get me this info for Enron? I'd be forever in your
debt.

thanks,

 kent

CEO & Founder, NthOrbit; Kumar Malavalli, Co-Founder & VP Technology, 
Brocade; Moderated by Gurmeet Naroola, Author, The Entrepreneurial Connection.

Silicon Vallley's rapid growth and vibrant development has benefited 
significantly from new entrants from all over the world.  Over 30% of new 
ventures in the Valley since 1980 have been founded by Indian and Chinese 
emigrants.  Unusually open and meritocratic, the Valley's strong network 
-based culture has provided a home for many bright young engineers seeking 
to establish themselves in the United States.  Natural risk takers, having 
already chosen to emigrate to the U.S., they often opt to found their own 
companies if careers in big firms do not prove rewarding.  Mutual support 
and networking groups of all kinds enhanced the ability of these new 
entrants to succeed- and succeed they did!  On November 29, we are happy to 
host a panel of entrepreneurs who exemplify this important phenomenon.

Registration:
You may pre- register until Tuesday, November 27, 2001 at 4 PM. The pre-

NetLibrary's unhappy ending

Net Library Inc., founded to share university library resources 
and costs, filed for bankruptcy. The Online Computer Library 
Center has made an offer to buy the 4-year-old Dublin, Ohio, 
company's assets including 40,000 digitized versions of books 
for $10 million. ""Ebooks complement our growing ejournal 
collection and provide exciting new synergies for our 
cataloging, resource sharing, reference and digital preservation 
services,"" said OCLC President Jay Jordan.

President gets Net tax ban bill

Legislation exempting the Internet from state and local taxes is 
awaiting a signature from President Bush for it to become law. 
The U.S. Senate OK'd the bill yesterday. It protects the Web 
from levies until November 1, 2003. One study suggests states 
lose $13.3 billion in uncollected sales taxes on Web commerce.

GM to park ebusiness inside

General Motors will move its ebusiness division under the 
company's corporate wing, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Mark Hogan, head of the 100-person eGM unit, said ""We're on a 
migration path to weave it into the organization."" Hogan expects 
to find another position within GM, he said. GM is still 
interested in exploiting the Web, but ""people are doing a lot 
less arm-waving about it"" with the end of the Internet bubble.

Assembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would
grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using
reclaimed water.  The bill is in its infancy and none of the details have
been worked out.  His office would like to know if Enron would be interested
in providing technical assistance with the measure.  They approached Enron
because of the Roseville plant, recognizing that Roseville already has its
air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water.

Jennifer,
I thought I should ask Jeff Dasovich to attend for us.  Jeff, please be
on your good behavior!  He will try to be there if he can.  He used to
work for Kathleen at Enron, by the way.

Subject: AReM Planning Meeting


Since I've gotten a couple questions about this today....just a
reminder,
AReM is holding an in person planning meeting on Monday November 19. We
plan
to start about 10 am (although a couple members won't be able to arrive
until 10:30). 

The meeting will be held at 345 California St, 32nd Floor. You can just
come
up to our floor (no additional security measures in the lobby),
reception
will have you sign in and tell you how to get to the conference room.
The
meeting is likely to run until mid-afternoon. 

We have not put together a formal agenda - but we plan to discuss AReM
strategy and focus for next year. If you will not be able to attend, but
would like to float concerns, positions etc - please go ahead and
circulate
them by Monday morning and I'll make sure they are discussed (ie get
copies
to anyone who couldn't access their email prior to the meeting). 

See you Monday
Jennifer

> ****************************
>
> Dear WildAlert Subscriber,
>
> National Forest roadless areas are *again* under attack from the Bush
> Administration and the U.S. Forest Service.  This time, the Forest
> Service is issuing yet another administrative ""directive"" that chips
> away at roadless area protections, protections Americans have voiced
> support for time and time again.  Please tell the Forest Service by
> NOVEMBER 19th that you strongly oppose the proposed ""Categorical
> Exclusions"" directive --
> http://www.wilderness.org/takeaction/?step=2&item=855
>
> CATEGORICAL EXCLUSIONS
> The latest Forest Service proposal would greatly weaken environmental
> review requirements for Forest Service management activities in
> National Forest roadless areas.
>
> Categorical Exclusions (CE) are used when a land management activity
> is believed to have an insignificant effect on the environment.  CEs
> can be used currently on a variety of activities, including relatively
> small logging and road-building activities.
>
> WHEN CEs CANNOT BE USED
> Until now, if certain extraordinary circumstances are present in the
> area in question, then CEs generally cannot be used.  Those
> circumstances include: inventoried roadless areas, threatened or
> endangered species habitat, municipal watersheds, Native American
> religious and cultural sites, or Research Natural Areas.
>
> PROPOSAL EXPANDS THE USE OF CEs
> The Forest Service proposal would change that, and allow the use of
> Categorical Exclusions for activities affecting these critical
> National Forest resources.  It reverses a long-standing agency policy
> originally set during the previous Bush Administration.
>
> Under the Forest Service's proposal, a broader range of activities
> that now require environmental review would be allowed in roadless
> areas under a Categorical Exclusion (i.e., without a review),
> including motorized trail construction, construction of utility lines,
> and some mining activities.
>
> TAKE ACTION
> The Forest Service is soliciting comments on this proposal, but only
> through NOVEMBER 19th.  We must let the Forest Service and the current
> Bush Administration know that the American people continue to pay
> attention to the environmental wounds that they are inflicting on our
> National Forests.  You can send your comments from
> http://www.wilderness.org/takeaction/?step=2&item=855 or tell the
> Forest Service directly:
>
> - That you strongly oppose the proposed directive.
>
> - National Forest roadless areas, endangered and threatened species
> habitat, municipal watersheds, Native American religious and cultural
> sites, and other special wildlands should be afforded the strongest
> possible protections.
>
> - Any project involving these resources should continue to have public
> involvement and must disclose impacts through preparation of an
> environmental impact statement.

Tuesday, Nov. 20th, between 6:15 and 7.:30 AM portions of the Haas network

unforeseen problems.  The outages will affect the HCS server room, the 
first 2 floors of Cheit Hall, and the east end of the 4th, 5th, and 6th 
floors of the Faculty wing.

During the outage email will be held for later delivery.

Should you experience any problems with computing services following the 
upgrades, please restart your computer.  If the problem persists,

Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Summary:
1. IPPs Rise 5.0%   Last week our IPP composite rose 5.0%, outperforming the
S&P 500 (+1.6%) and the NASDAQ (+3.8%). AES Corp (AES), which was up 22.2%,
was the strongest generator in the group followed by Reliant Resources (RRI)
which rose 11.0%.  Orion Power (ORN) was the weakest performer, rising 1.2%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 2.8%   Our universe of
generation-oriented utilities fell 2.8%, in-line with the UTY (-2.5%).
Black Hills (BKH), Cleco (CNL) and Constellation Energy (CEG) all rose less
than 1%.  Allegheny Energy was the weakest performer, down 7.6%.

3. ENE/DYN + Attractive Valuations Boost Stock Prices   Last week was the
3rd consecutive week of positive stock price performance for the group.
Driving stock prices higher, investors continued to grow more comfortable
with the Enron situation following confirmation of Dynegy's intention to
acquire Enron and provide immediate liquidity support by investing $1.5
billion.  Further, we believe the group simply remains oversold.  The pure
play power producers are trading at a 7% average discount to their private
market asset values.  

4. Notes From Mirant Meeting   Mirant hosted an upbeat analyst meeting last
Tuesday.  MIR reiterated that 80% of its 2002 forecast is supported by
earnings from hedged (generation and natural gas) and franchise businesses
(distribution).  MIR also provided an in-depth review of how it accounts for
its risk management activities.  Management noted that it could maintain its
credit rating without any new equity issuance over the next 12 months.
However, it would be eager to access the equity market should conditions
improve in the near-term.  

5. Power Market Update   Last week the US power markets were generally weak
across the country owing to mild weather and falling natural gas prices.
While the Mirant National Power Index fell 17.1% last week, the Natural Gas
Week composite spot price fell 23.2%.  Spark spreads improved in the
Northeast and Texas, while compressing in California and the Southeast.  

6. Debt Market Update   Credit spreads tightened across the sector last week
due to diminished ENE concerns and positive stock price performance.

<br>Not often do most of us get a chance to witness the
<br>beginnings of an entire new technology. At Pervasive
<br>Computing Outlook, Robert MacGregor, founder,
<br>president, and CEO of NanoMuscle, will introduce us
<br>to the wonders of a new miniature linear motion
<br>technology that may displace one of today&#39;s most
<br>widely used conventional technologies, small
<br>electromagnetic motors. These tiny actuators--or
<br>""nanomuscles""--can be mass produced at low cost
<br>and promise to find their way into a wide range
<br>of products from toys, cameras, and consumer
<br>electronics products to computer peripherals
<br>and automobiles.

MARKETS TO START WEEK ON A POSITIVE NOTE

Equities were poised to continue the uptrend from overseas at 
the open on mostly upbeat homebuilding data. October housing 
starts reflected a softening but still robust market for new 
home building, while the more forward-looking building permits 
pointed to a potentially deteriorating situation. In equities 
news, home-improvement retailer Lowe's Companies (LOW,40) posted 
strong 3Q results and gave optimistic guidance, while oil giants 
Phillips Petroleum (P,52,f2) and Conono Inc. (COC,24,f2) 
announced a strategic merger.

Phillips Petroleum has agreed to purchase rival Conoco Inc. for 
$15.4 billion, creating the third-largest U.S. oil company in a 
move to enhance competitive positioning. Conoco shareholders 
will receive 0.4677 shares of the combined company, 
ConocoPhillips, for each of their original shares, valuing the 
shares at $24.30, roughly equal to Friday's closing price. 
Additionally, Phillips' CEO said the company will eliminate jobs 
following the merger in an effort to reign in costs and cut 
duplicate positions. The companies hope to close the deal by the 
second half of 2002.

Lowe's Companies posted a 24% rise in fiscal 3Q net income to 
$0.32 per share, $0.01 ahead of the First Call $0.31 per share 
consensus forecast. Sales rose 21% to $5.45 billion, with 
same-store sales rising 4%. The company's CEO noted strength in 
all product categories across every geographic region and said 
that consumer traffic accelerated during the quarter. Lowe's 
expects fiscal 2002 profits of $1.24-$1.25 per share, ahead of 
the Street's $1.23 mean estimate.

Shares of Andrx Group (ADRX,63,f1) were higher in premarket 
activity after the generic drug maker reported Friday that the 
FDA had granted it permission to market a generic form of 
AstraZeneca PLC's (AZN,46,f2) Prilosec ulcer medication, which 
generated more than $6 billion in global sales last year. 
Although AstraZeneca's primary U.S. patent on the drug expired 
on Oct. 5, the London-based pharmaceutical manufacturer claims 
that generic versions of the drug would violate several related 
patents, which, if upheld, would prolong U.S. exclusivity rights 
for several years.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Treasuries rose following the release of this morning's housing 
starts data. Total starts for October fell 1.3% to a 1.552 
million annual rate from September's revised 1.572 million pace. 
Analysts were expecting a 4.7% decline to an annual rate of 
1.500 million starts. The weakness was most noticeable in the 
West. Despite the unexpected resiliency in the housing market, 
buoyed by historically low interest rates, the more 
forward-looking building permits fell 3.6% in October on the 
heels of a revised 2.7% decline the prior month. Permits were 
previously reported as having dropped 3.0% in September.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

Despite a Bundesbank report that German economic growth was 
sequentially flat in 3Q and may be weaker in 4Q, European 
bourses climbed higher on renewed optimism that lower interest 
rates and falling crude prices will eventually stimulate 
economic growth in 2002. The Bloomberg 500 index was up 1.3% as 
of 8:56 a.m. EST, led by computer-related and telecom stocks. 
The euro was lower against the dollar after hawkish European 
Central Bank officials commented that current euro-zone interest 
rates are appropriate.

Asian markets were also higher, with Japan's Nikkei-225 index 
closing up 0.74%, in spite of the Bank of Japan's dour 
assessment of the economy, including concerns about the effects 
of declining exports and output on consumer sentiment and 
spending. The yen was lower against the dollar following the 
Bank of Japan's economic downgrade. Nevertheless, enthusiasm 
about an improving outlook in the U.S., as well as a softer yen, 
carried export stocks, including Toyota (TM,50,f2) and Sony 
Corp. (SNE,46) higher. Crude oil trailed lower again amid fresh 
concerns that Russia will offer nothing more in the way of 
concessions than a meager, symbolic production cut.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:56 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was 7 points higher while the Nasdaq 100 index was 
up 19 points. The December DJIA futures contract was up 55 
points (58 points above fair value) and the December crude oil 
futures traded on the NYMEX were down $0.79 at $17.24/barrel.

62633,"

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.

           
7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

STOCKS HIGHER MIDDAY

U.S. equities were higher midday on the heels of 
better-than-expected economic data and predominantly positive 
equity news. October housing starts reflected a softening but 
still robust market for new home building, though building 
permits data was weaker. In equities news, Philips Petroleum 
(P,52,f2) and Conoco Inc. (COC,25,f2) announced a strategic 
merger, and Dow component Alcoa Inc. (AA,38,f2) said it would 
eliminate jobs in a cost-cutting move. Meanwhile, U.S. 
Treasuries were trading higher midday and European markets were 
posting gains late in the session.

As of 11:55 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 
0.58%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.86%. The S&P 500 Index was up 
0.47%. Computer related and retail issues drove the advancers 
while oil and semiconductors paced the decliners.

Phillips Petroleum was trading higher after it agreed to 
purchase rival Conoco Inc. for more than $15 billion, creating 
the third largest U.S. oil company. Conoco shareholders will 
receive 0.4677 shares of the combined company, ConocoPhillips, 
for each of their original shares. Additionally, Phillips' CEO 
said the company will eliminate jobs following the merger in an 
effort to reign in costs and cut duplicate positions. The 
companies hope to close the deal by the second half of 2002.

Shares of Alcoa Inc. were higher after the Dow component 
announced it would cut 6,500 workers, or 4.6% of its work force, 
and close plants in America and Europe in an effort to reduce 
expenses amid declining aluminum demand. The company said it 
would incur 4Q charges of up to $250 million as a result of the 
restructuring and that the decision was designed to ""optimize 
Alcoa's manufacturing system after a recent series of 
acquisitions.""

Lowe's Companies (LOW,42) got a lift after it posted a 24% rise 
in fiscal 3Q net income to $0.32 per share, $0.01 ahead of the 
First Call $0.31 per share consensus forecast. Sales rose 21% to 
$5.45 billion, with same-store sales rising 4%. The company's 
CEO noted strength in all product categories across every 
geographic region, saying consumer traffic accelerated during 
the quarter. Lowe's expects fiscal 2002 profits of $1.24-$1.25 
per share, ahead of the Street's $1.23 mean estimate.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Treasuries were higher midday, recouping some of last week's 
sharp losses, despite the stronger-than-expected housing starts 
data. Total starts for October fell 1.3% to a 1.552 million unit 
annual rate from September's revised 1.572 million unit pace. 
Analysts were expecting a 4.7% decline to a 1.500 million unit 
annual rate. Weakness was most noticeable in the West. Despite 
the unexpected resiliency in the housing market, buoyed by 
historically low interest rates, the more forward-looking 
building permits fell 3.6% in October, roughly matching 
expectations, on the heels of a revised 2.7% decline the prior 
month. Permits were previously reported as having dropped 3.0% 
in September.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets were higher later in the day, despite a 
Bundesbank report reflecting sequentially flat 3Q German 
economic growth and a potentially weaker 4Q. Optimism that lower 
interest rates and falling crude prices will eventually 
stimulate economic expansion helped boost the Bloomberg 500 
index, which was up 1.24% as of 11:55 a.m. EST. Telecoms and 
financials paced the advancers, while pharmaceuticals and foods 
led the decliners. In equities news, Microsoft Corp. 
(MSFT,66,f1) formally responded to European Union charges that 
it violated anti-trust laws in a written rebuttal addressing the 
Commission's objections. The euro was down against the U.S. 
dollar following weekend comments from hawkish European Central 
Bank officials hinting that they may not reduce euro-zone 
interest rates further. Crude oil was lower amid renewed 
concerns that Russia will offer nothing more in the way of OPEC 
concessions than a meager, symbolic production cut.

AOL, Yahoo start charity Web site

AOL Time Warner, Yahoo and Cisco Systems announced Monday a Web 
site they've launched to enable 850,000 charities to solicit 
donations, recruit volunteers and collect comments.

The purpose of NetworkforGood.org is to help nonprofit 
organizations become more effective and efficient by integrating 
the Internet into their fundraising and related activities. ""We 
will be able to make giving, volunteering and speaking out on 
issues as central a part of the Internet as shopping or getting 
e-mail,"" said Steve Case, AOL Time Warner's chairman.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Olympic-sized sports Web site

General Electric's NBC, Microsoft's MSNBC.com and the MSN 
network launched Monday what they said will be the largest event 
Web site in sports history. The Olympics-oriented site is 
available at http://www.olympics.com/ and 
http://www.nbcolympics.com/. During the 2002 Winter Games in 
Salt Lake City, the site will feature exclusive live results. 
Slide shows of events and athletes will be a focus of the site's 
coverage. It also includes a schedule of events and a ticket 
auction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Investor site to charge for alerts

BestCalls.com will begin charging subscription fees for its 
CallTracker service. ""The revenues generated by CallTracker 
subscriptions will be re-invested into the business to expand 
our research, customer service and marketing efforts,"" said Mark 
Coker, BestCalls' founder. Email alerts for conference call 
schedules and access information will cost professional 
investors and business users $495 a year; individuals will be 
charged $49.95 a year. The service currently has 80,000 
subscribers receiving its email alerts at no charge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Overstock.com expects profitability

Overstock.com's Patrick Byrne said Monday his company has been 
profitable this month and he expects more of the same for the 
future. ""We expect to be unreasoningly profitable in December 
and thereafter,"" the CEO said. He expects the company's sales to 
total $100 million this year. Overstock.com has specialized in 
making bulk purchases of manufacturers' and retailers' surplus 
goods. Now, the company is moving into sales of new items. Byrne 
said the company will offer as many as 350 different titles, 
included on various best-seller lists and priced 10% below 
Amazon's price. Previously, Overstock.com partnered with 
Amazon.com to sell PCs. Byrne canceled the deal, complaining of 
poor results.

We have some very sad news from State Senator Bruce McPherson. On Saturday
morning, his 27 year old son was murdered in San Francisco during an
attempted robbery. Hunter McPherson will be remembered during a  memorial
service in Aptos on Wednesday, November 21.

The family has also set up an athletic scholarship fund in his name. We have
additional information if you need it.

Please remember this wonderful family in your thoughts and prayers.

Subject: Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost
Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a
rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to
resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related
hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also
address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The
ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week
so
that I can send in the required letter.     


Jeanne Bennett

Thanks for the help.  I'll take whatever I can get.  Are you going to be
in Napa for Thanksgiving?  I think we're coming up Saturday and watching
some ball on Sunday.

I couldn't open your attachment, but I suspect it's in my mailbox somewhere 
anyway.  We did support the Migden bill on community aggregation, ABX2 9, 
but the governor vetoed it.  I'm not sure where that leaves the program, 
but I'll see what the forces of darkness have to say.

Dear Students,

The library will close at 5pm on Wednesday, November 21 (the day before
Thanksgiving) and will be closed through Thanskgiving, Thursday, November
22. Will re-open from 1-5pm on Friday, November 23 and resume regular
weekend and other hours thereafter.

Though you will be in classes on Wednesday, you will find that most of Haas
and the UCB campus are in ""out for holidays"" mode. I will not be here on
Wednesday since the library will be closed in the evening. Send weekend
questions NOW if you want a response from me before next Monday.

Give yourselves a nice holiday and I look forward to seeing your refreshed
faces when you return.

The results for the week are:
1st place - Cameron and Scott
2nd place - JAM
3rd place tie - Prentice and Scott & Val

Congratulations to all.

Now it's about time for the last 4 players to make some weekly money:  Pat,
Dave, Daryl and the Sheas.   The Sheas are still in 7th place and haven't
won a nickel??!!  Go figure!

Top 10 ranking changes:
Hank and Donna dropped out
WAM and Prentice moved in

Please remember to get your picks in before the 9:30 game on Thursday
morning.

We wish you all a wonderful holiday surrounded by the friends and family for
whom we are all so thankful!

</td><td rowspan=""2"">
<table border=""0"" width=""90%"" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><font face=""verdana, arial, geneva, helvetica"" size=""2"">On Monday, VentureWire learned that Guide Ventures, a VC firm focused on West Coast-based seed and early stage IT companies, expects to raise $60 million to $70 million for its third fund next year. The firm will soon finish up investing out of its Guide Fund II, a $21 million fund that has a portfolio of 12 companies so far. Guide Fund III will invest 75% in wireless applications, IT infrastructure, and security and the rest in tools and applications for bioinformatics, a new investment focus for the firm.<br><br>For the 16 startups that pulled in a total of $146 million, including AcceLight, which landed a $60 million Series B, it was a good start to the holiday week. Not so for TechTV. The 24-hour cable television channel covering technology, information,
and entertainment news, said it has laid off 130 employees, a reported 25% of its total staff. The company, which was formerly known as ZDTV, is owned by Vulcan Ventures.<br><br>It may not be bad news for the company, but SafeWeb&#39;s decision to discontiue its free consumer service didn&#39;t brighten the holiday spirits of that service&#39;s users. The company, which develops a secure Web browser that blocks the ability to trace browsing, said it has discontinued the free service to focus on business customers. The company may re-launch the consumer service through a fee-based subscription model, but it is currently focused on its new enterprise security product that has been in development for several months. SafeWeb has received funding from In-Q-Tel, the
CIA&#39;s venture capital fund, which could mean the move is plot of a vast government conspiracy or perhaps it&#39;s just an attempt to actually turn a profit.</font></td></tr></table>

<br>A VentureWire Special Report
<br>
<br>Sure, venture money is harder to come by than ever,
<br>but not  impossible. In a Venture Wire Special Report
<br>you can order  today, we&#39;ll detail the investors who
<br>have the capital, time,  and willingness to fund
<br>expansion rounds. You might be  surprised: It&#39;s not
<br>the usual suspects. Hundreds of young  companies are
<br>being funded every week -- not just seed rounds but
<br>Series B, C, and even later -- and the VentureWire
<br>Special report lists the seasoned investors who are
<br>doing such deals  outside their own portfolios.
<br>These days, executive time is  more precious than
<br>ever; so don&#39;t waste it looking for money from VCs
<br>who are fully invested, or engulfed with  triage on
<br>ailingn portfolios. Pitch the firms with plenty of
<br>capital and a demonstrated recent willingness to
<br>invest  to help startups survive the downturn, and
<br>thrive in the  upturn. Order your VentureWire Special
<br>Report now, and you&#39;ll  get our real-time analysis of
<br>today&#39;s money-raising environment,  as well as the
<br>list of key contacts inside the VC firms that  are
<br>the most active investors. The research, based on up-
<br>to-the-minute reporting from VentureWire, will be
<br>published next month. Reserve your copy today for the
<br>discounted, pre-publication price of $365. (Price on
<br>publication $495.) Send e-mail to

<br>lead into gold than it does turning silicon into cash.
<br>Alchemy Semiconductor, an Austin-based fabless
<br>semiconductor company founded by key members of the
<br>former DEC Alpha/StrongARM design team, has focused its
<br>wizards on developing high-performance, low-cost
<br>systems-on-a-chip for PDAs, Internet appliances, and

<br>is a processor that can handle real-time streaming
<br>video and audio in the MPEG-4 format. CEO Jim Moore

SOFTER OPEN FOR EQUITIES

Equity index futures were pointing to a lower open for the 
market amid a quiet news day. The trade deficit narrowed more 
than expected, owing primarily to one-time effects of insurance 
claims related to the Sept. 11 attacks, but had little effect on 
the markets. In corporate news, P&O Princess Cruises PLC 
(POC,18.10) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL,15.01) 
revealed merger plans while office supply giant Staples 
(SPLS,18.66,f1) matched earnings expectations and offered upbeat 
guidance.

P&O Princess Cruises PLC and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
announced merger plans in an effort to address the demand 
slowdown for leisure cruises in the wake of September's 
terrorist attacks. As part of the roughly $2.89 billion 
agreement, each Royal Caribbean share will be worth about 3.46 
shares in ""Loveboat"" owner, P&O Princess. The two cruiselines 
will continue to trade separately, and the deal gives a small 
premium to Royal Caribbean shareholders. P&O Princess 
shareholders will own 50.7% of the group, while Royal Caribbean 
shareholders will hold the remaining 49.3%.

Staples Inc., the second largest office-supply retailer, said 
fiscal 3Q profits rose nearly 8% to $0.20 per share, matching 
the First Call consensus estimate, on a 1.1% rise in sales to 
$2.83 billion. The company credits the elimination of 
unprofitable merchandise and its cost-management efforts for the 
quarter's results, despite a slump following the September 
attacks. Staples says it sees fiscal 4Q results of $0.25-$0.27 
per share, as compared to the Street's $0.25 per share consensus 
estimate.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Treasuries were higher but retreated a bit following this 
morning's U.S. trade gap numbers. The U.S. trade deficit fell 
sharply in September to $18.69 billion from September's $27.11 
billion due primarily to anomalous effects of insurance claims 
related to September's attacks, which reduced services imports 
by $11 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Analysts 
per Dow Jones Newswires were expecting a narrowing in the trade 
deficit to $26.00 billion. Overall, imports plunged 14.0% to 
$95.99 billion while exports declined 8.5% to $77.29 billion.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets were lower after the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development lowered its growth forecast for the 
euro-zone economy to 1.4% in 2002 from its previous 2.7% 
estimate in May and said more monetary easing may be warranted. 
Telecom service and industrial products stocks led the declining 
issues, while travel and leisure stocks got a boost from the 
Royal Caribbean, P&O Princess merger news. Credit Suisse Group 
(CSR,42) dropped after providing cautious 4Q guidance, even 
though it posted a better-than-expected 3Q net loss. The euro 
was higher against the dollar despite being pressured earlier 
following worse-than-expected Italian industrial orders and 
sales for September. Orders declined 6.6% on the month and 10.0% 
year-over-year, while sales were down 1.9% on the month and 4.7% 
year over year. German factory orders also declined in 
September. The Bloomberg European 500 index was down 1.06% as of 
8:52 a.m. EST.

Asian stocks were also under pressure with technology, 
communications and insurance stocks leading Japan's Nikkei down 
1.4% at the close. The OECD predicts contractions of 0.7% and 
1.0% in 2001 and 2002 respectively, before the Japanese economy 
expands an estimated 0.8% in 2003, noting that the Bank of Japan 
has little stimulative flexibility with lending rates close to 
zero. Nikon Corp. (NINOF,9.13) was lower after posting a huge 
drop in first-half profits and saying that it anticipates a 
full-year loss as demand for semiconductor equipment wanes. The 
yen was trading higher against the dollar.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:52 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was 6.5 points lower (4 points below fair value) 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 16 points (8 points below 
fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was down 59 
points (41 points below fair value) and the January crude oil 
futures traded on the NYMEX were up $0.93 at $19.36/barrel.

Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that E=
SPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commissio=
n by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who =
sign a ""suitable"" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow=
:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct acc=
ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc=
t access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shal=
l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme=
nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A failure =
to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be consi=
dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a=
nd agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual =
contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's Doc=
ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e=
xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect=
ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be =
submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =20

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w=
ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order=
 and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission =
staff by December 11, 2001.=20

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons=
e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja=
nuary 4, 2002.

As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name=
s, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and WPTF=
 are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they=
 wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this=
 Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering our =
options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very prelimina=
ry analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o=
ver either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also particula=
rly outrageous because of the statements that, ""A failure to submit this in=
formation for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of=
 the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements=
"" and ""Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag=
reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement=
s are in effect.""  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat=
ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor=
s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend=
ent customers. =20
=20
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is t=
ime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPU=
RR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Gove=
rnor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be very=
 much appreciated.

Thanks, Dan.  I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have
any choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer
up any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to
attempt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due
process rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.

Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that
ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the
Commission by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other
parties who sign a ""suitable"" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs
read as follow:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct
access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend
direct access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001,
shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or
agreements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A
failure to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will
be considered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the
contracts and agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of
the actual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the
Commission's Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
Robert Barnett.

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have
executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed
protective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which
shall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3.  

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall
work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order
and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission
staff by December 11, 2001. 

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in response
to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by
January 4, 2002.


As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own
names, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and
WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course
they wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight
this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering
our options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very
preliminary analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have
jurisdiction over either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is
also particularly outrageous because of the statements that, ""A failure to
submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be
considered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving the
contracts and agreements"" and ""Parties to this proceeding may have access to
these contracts and agreements after the appropriate protective order and
nondisclosure agreements are in effect.""  The former is a likely denial of
due process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing
information to ESP competitors and exposes sensitive pricing information to
competitors of energy-dependent customers.  
 
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is
time for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC,
SPURR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the
Governor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be
very much appreciated.

i'm finer and finer, and still not with a jobjob but
not really wanting a jobjob, too scared of going back

getting laid off again, must be some kind of fear of
intimacy problem..... but i'll probably want to get
real intimate again as soon as the $$$$ runs
out....... going to seattle for thanksgiving at
kevin's, 35 people this year, yay, and lots of little
cute kids running around, and, well, i couldn't sleep
last night and tossed and turned and finally fell
asleep at 6 or so and missed my yoga class at 9....
this is my life, and it ain't have bad.... no no

Thanks, Dan.  I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have
any choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer
up any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to
attempt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due
process rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.
 
Best,
Jeff

Subject: IMPORTANT ! !


Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that
ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the
Commission by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other
parties who sign a ""suitable"" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs
read as follow:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct
access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend
direct access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001,
shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or
agreements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A
failure to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will
be considered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the
contracts and agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of
the actual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the
Commission's Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
Robert Barnett.

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have
executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed
protective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which
shall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3.  

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall
work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order
and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission
staff by December 11, 2001. 

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in response
to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by
January 4, 2002.


As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own
names, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and
WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course
they wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight
this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering
our options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very
preliminary analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have
jurisdiction over either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is
also particularly outrageous because of the statements that, ""A failure to
submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be
considered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving the
contracts and agreements"" and ""Parties to this proceeding may have access to
these contracts and agreements after the appropriate protective order and
nondisclosure agreements are in effect.""  The former is a likely denial of
due process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing
information to ESP competitors and exposes sensitive pricing information to
competitors of energy-dependent customers.  
 
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is
time for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC,
SPURR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the
Governor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be
very much appreciated.

STOCKS LOWER MIDDAY

U.S. equities are lower midday following mixed second tier 
economic data and retail sector earnings reports. The U.S. trade 
deficit dropped sharply in September and the index of leading 
economic indicators rose. Meanwhile, Target Corp. (TGT,36,f2) 
and Staples Inc. (SPLS,18.76,f1) met profit estimates, while 
Deere & CO (DE,38) beat expectations. U.S. Treasuries are 
trading lower and European markets are posting declines.

As of 11:51 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 
0.65%, while the Nasdaq was down 1.22%. The S&P 500 Index was 
down 0.43%. Semiconductors and communication equipment issues 
paced the decliners while oil related shares led the advancers.

Shares of Deere & Co. are lower after the largest U.S. farm 
equipment maker reported a 4Q operating loss of $0.45 per share, 
$0.01 better than the First Call consensus, on a 6.5% drop in 
sales as the weak economy hurt production and shipments. The 
company also said it intends to eliminate a Tennessee plant and 
its 300 workers, and cut 10% of its headquarters' employees amid 
expectations for declining 1Q sales.

Target Corp. is trading lower after reporting release of 3Q 
operating earnings of $0.25 per share, matching analysts' 
expectations per First Call, driven by higher sales and profits 
at the Target discount chain. The retailer reported sales rose 
8.6% with same-store sales increasing 1.5%. Target's CEO also 
said, ""we believe our strategies position us well to deliver 
reasonable growth in earnings per share in the fourth quarter.""

Staples Inc., the second largest office-supply retailer, said 
fiscal 3Q profits rose nearly 8% to $0.20 per share, matching 
the First Call consensus estimate, on a 1.1% rise in sales to 
$2.83 billion. The company credits the elimination of 
unprofitable merchandise and its cost-management efforts for the 
quarter's results, despite a slump following the September 
attacks. Staples says it sees fiscal 4Q results of $0.25-$0.27 
per share, as compared to the Street's $0.25 per share consensus 
estimate.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Treasuries are flat midday following this morning's economic 
data. The U.S. trade deficit fell sharply in September to $18.69 
billion from September's $27.11 billion due primarily to the 
anomalous effects of insurance claims related to September's 
attacks, which reduced services imports by $11 billion, 
according to the Commerce Department. Analysts per Dow Jones 
Newswires were expecting a narrowing in the trade deficit to 
$26.00 billion. Overall, imports plunged 14.0% to $95.99 billion 
while exports declined 8.5% to $77.29 billion.

The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators for 
October rose 0.3% following September's 0.5% decline, better 
than the flat reading expected per Bloomberg. The index, 
designed to measure economic performance over the upcoming 3-6 
month period, saw seven of its 10 component measures record 
positive readings. The index of coincident indicators, designed 
to measure current activity, dropped 0.2% in October following a 
flat reading in September, while the index of lagging indicators 
fell 0.3% after September's 0.2% decline.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are lower midday with the Bloomberg European 
500 down 1.48% as of 11:51 a.m. EST. Telecom and financials led 
the decliners while energy and travel/leisure issues paced the 
advancers. Contributing to the decline, the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development lowered its growth forecast 
for the euro-zone economy to 1.4% in 2002 from its previous 2.7% 
estimate in May and said more monetary easing may be warranted. 
The euro is higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially helped 
by reports that China's central bank intends to add the currency 
to its forex reserves, which are the second largest worldwide. 
Crude oil got a boost after the Mexican energy minister said 
that an agreement could soon be reached for non-OPEC producers 
to reduce output by 500,000 barrels per day.

Thought you all might like to know about our recent merger.

Subject: 


Dave and I wanted to inform you and IEP of the recent merger between
Edson + Modisette and another highly reputable Sacramento
consulting/advocacy firm, Public Policy Advocates.  

As you well know, Edson + Modisette has experienced some major changes
this year, with the retirement of Karen Edson and the departure of one
of our long-time consultants, Cece Martin.  These changes also created a
new opportunity for us to partner with others that can improve our
capabilities.

The merger has given Dave and I and our clients the ability to draw upon
additional people, many with valuable skills, and additional resources.
Public Policy Advocates is a long-standing firm in Sacramento, founded
and headed by Fred Taugher, who among other things was the Director of
the Assembly Rules Committee for many years and come this January
celebrates 40 years of experience in public policy.  Fred gives us a new
dimension of political access and strength we have never had before.
There are also three other advocates in the firm that IEP could call
upon if needed:  Amy Zajac and Steve Cruz who each have ten years of
experience in the Capitol, and Jennifer Wada who cut her teeth in public
policy arena during this year's energy crisis.  There will also be
additional support staff, and other resources that we can draw upon.

What hasn't changed is my concentration on energy issues both in the
Legislative and regulatory arenas.  

Public Policy Advocates has a long client list which, if you are
interested, you can see on the Secretary of State's web site at

In short, I believe the merger of Edson + Modisette and PPA will have
significant benefits, in terms of influence, and access, and
availability of additional resources.  

As IEP contemplates its agenda for the second half of the legislative
session, I greatly hope you include our new team in your plans. 

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Thanks, I pass it on to Chris.

I haven't heard back on Lodi. I'll check.

McCrae said the issue has slowed down due to our comments and some CPUC
actions.  Bottorff doesn't know when it will happen, but Tom and I will make
sure you're included.  McCrae wants to see a proposal on the exit fee.  I'll
make sure you get one.

On the GRC, the Commission issued an Order to Show Cause today for us AND
Edison on the failure to file and NOI.  I sent a note to Florio saying we
may need him as a witness on feasibility, that even though he thought our
GRC filings looked like they'd been put together in 20 days, ...

Take care.

Subject: Couple things


Greetings Dan:  Few things.

*	Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your
plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
*	Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit
more ""outside the box"" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.
Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start
meeting with them.
*	Any word on getting a conference call together with the large
customers?
*	Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any
stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?

Have a great holiday weekend.

Best,
Jeff

Dan and myself were on the line for about 20 minutes, finished and got off.
Dan has contacted, by e-mail, some of the major customer groups with the
suggestion of a broad coalition response to the ACR.  I suggested he send a
note calling for a conference call with them on Monday, Nov. 26 at 2:30

Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that
ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the
Commission by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other
parties who sign a ""suitable"" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs
read as follow:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct
access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend
direct access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001,
shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or
agreements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A
failure to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will
be considered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the
contracts and agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of
the actual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the
Commission's Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
Robert Barnett.

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have
executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed
protective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which
shall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3.  

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall
work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order
and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission
staff by December 11, 2001. 

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in response
to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by
January 4, 2002.


As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own
names, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and
WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course
they wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight
this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering
our options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very
preliminary analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have
jurisdiction over either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is
also particularly outrageous because of the statements that, ""A failure to
submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be
considered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving the
contracts and agreements"" and ""Parties to this proceeding may have access to
these contracts and agreements after the appropriate protective order and
nondisclosure agreements are in effect.""  The former is a likely denial of
due process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing
information to ESP competitors and exposes sensitive pricing information to
competitors of energy-dependent customers.  
 
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is
time for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC,
SPURR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the
Governor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be
very much appreciated.

for Tuesday, November 20, 2001

Stocks, bonds and babes

If the bottom falls out of the market, wouldn't it be better to 
hear about it from someone not wearing a bottom? Perhaps this 
was the genesis of MarketwrapUnwrapped.com, a Sydney, 
Australia-based Web site featuring naked women offering stock 
market reports. Streaming video of two women, wearing little but 
smiles, greets visitors to the site. ""Oh, hi! Thanks for 
checking us out,"" says one of them, Georgie Jestico. The Web 
site's biography section says she was born in England and has 
completed two years at ""San Francisco University,"" though 
there's not a school in San Francisco by that exact name. She 
and three other anchor/models deliver ""all the market news. 
Takeovers, mergers and bums,"" they say in a video teaser to 
encourage subscribers to pay $9.95 monthly for real-time 
updates. The announcers begin their reports clothed, and remove 
clothing as they go through the news. ""There is no market 
advice, it's just a wrap,"" explained Sam Ruddock, the site's 
managing director, in an interview with Reuters. ""It is very 
tame. It's only R rated,"" he added. Launched two weeks ago, 
Ruddock said the site has 50 subscribers.

Another such site, NakedNews.com, has been in business in two 
years. It recently expanded to offer two channels of 
programming, and now features 10 women and four men reporting 
news, sports and weather.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Online retailers get federal warning

The Federal Trade Commission has reminded online retailers of 
its regulations on shipping. The FTC said it surveyed 110 
Internet retailers and notified 72 of them of the mail order 
rule. It requires merchants to send orders to buyers consistent 
with the site's claim, or, if no time is stated, within 30 days. 
The commission found 52 of 110 sites made ""quick-ship claims."" 
Inadequate warranty information was also found on 52 sites, the 
agency reported. The warranty rule requires written warranties 
on consumer products costing more than $15 be made available to 
consumers before they buy.

The number of complaints about Internet retailers has become 
comparable to those about telemarketers and auto repair shops. 
The National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators and 
the Consumer Federation of America said consumer complaints 
about the Internet ranked eighth among the groups' top 10 
categories. The most commonly cited problems were about online 
purchases and auctions. ""People don't always get what they order 
over the Internet and sometimes they don't get anything at all,"" 
said Wendy Weinberg, executive director of the NACAA. She 
suggested buyers use credit cards, print out receipts and vary 
passwords on Web sites.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Online shopping holds little interest for most

Only one out of nine people say shopping online is their 
preference for this holiday season, according to Accenture 
research. ""Given a heightened fear of terrorism, it was somewhat 
surprising the physical store was by far the most popular 
shopping venue,"" the consulting firm's report said. For all 
shoppers, clothing items are the most popular gift items.

My apologies.  I got stuck on an interminable call and didn't call in till
just about 2:25, so I must have missed you.  I like your approach and think
a call on Monday is a great idea.  I've got Mike Day calling the customers,
too.  In the meantime, I'm gutting the utility proposal on DA suspension and
trying to turn into a one-pager of an approach we could support to pass
around to folks for consideration/review.  I'll hopefully have that done by
mid-morning tomorrow.  What's your direct dial and cell phone?

On November 14, 2001, SCE filed an advice to establish the ratemaking
necessary to implement a number of regulatory components included in its
October 2nd Settlement with the Commission 

The settlement agreement described the operation a new account termed the
PROACT that the Commission will establish by order. The advice letter
provides the structure and operation of the PROACT, The beginning balance of
the PROACT will consists of the unrecovered procurement related obligation
as of September 1, 2001. Beginning on Sept. 1, on a monthly basis, the
following amounts will be recorded in the PROACT: (1) SCE's Surplus
(recorded revenues minus recoverable costs); (2) all refunds related to
procurement related liabilities; (3) securitization proceeds, (4) interest
expense.

The advice letter provides a detailed explanation as to how SCE's surplus
and recoverable costs will be calculated.

In addition, the advice letter addresses settlement rates.  SCE notes that,
under the Settlement, the Commission agreed to maintain electric retail
rates for retail customers at no less than the Settlement Rates during the
Repayment Period.  Settlement Rates are defined in the Settlement as "" gross
electric retail rates (including surcharges)"".  In its advice letter, SCE
proposes to define gross electric retail rates to mean the system average
rates. By defining it that way, the Commission can change the revenue
allocation between rate groups, as well as effect some rate
increases/decreases in certain rate components as long as such revisions do
not result in a change in SCE's system average rates.

SCE has asked for a September 1, 2001 effective date for the advice filing.

Under standard procedures, protests on the filing would be due December 4th.
SCE has asked for an accelerated schedule of November 28. To date, as far as
I am aware, it has not been granted.

Please let me know as soon as possible if Enron would like to weigh in on
this advice filing.

Dear SVMG Member -

Last Friday at 1pm, we sent out an e-mail to you announcing a second
opportunity to participate in our Negotiating Skills Workshop, scheduled for
April 17, 2002.

By the close of business last Friday, the April 17 Workshop is also sold
out!  That is the bad news.  The GOOD NEWS is that the instructor - Joe
Crowley - and our host, Compaq (thanks Shawna Holmes!) have graciously
agreed to offer a second day - April 18 - for an additional class.

As you know, we first offered this Workshop a few weeks ago, to a sold out
group, and it was overwhelmingly popular.

Therefore, we are pleased to announce a third opportunity to participate in
the NEGOTIATING SKILLS WORKSHOP.  Once again, it is open to the first 20
RSVP's that we receive.

Details for this additional class are as follows:

DATE: April 18, 2002
TIME: 8am until 5pm
PLACE: Compaq Computer
COST: $250 covers the instruction, workbook, continental breakfast and light
lunch.

To sign up for the April 18 date, please respond to this e-mail as soon as
possible.  And thanks again for your interest.

Best wishes,

Carl", <20999577.1075859209445.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,2001-11-20 17:44:12-08:00, cguardino@svmg.org, cguardino@svmg.org, Negotiating Skills - SOLD OUT!,1

<br>you can order  today, we&#39;ll detail the investors who
<br>have the capital, time,  and willingness to fund

<br>who are fully invested, or engulfed with  triage on
<br>ailingn portfolios. Pitch the firms with plenty of
<br>capital and a demonstrated recent willingness to
<br>invest  to help startups survive the downturn, and
<br>thrive in the  upturn. Order your VentureWire Special

Morning Market View(TM)

as of 9:30AM EST
Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research


STOCKS POISED TO OPEN SLIGHTLY LOWER

Equity index futures were lower but off of early lows following 
better-than-expected economic data, reflecting possible 
stabilization in the job market. The futures had been down 
earlier amid contrasting earnings forecasts and a downgrade on 
technology titan Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,65,f1). Biotech 
bellwether Amgen Inc. (AMGN,58,f1) offered optimistic sales and 
earnings guidance, while Analog Devices (ADI,42,f2) was more 
pessimistic. Treasuries fell on the jobless numbers, while bleak 
European economic data limited strength in the euro-zone.

In equities news, Microsoft Corp. was lower in the premarket 
session after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst downgraded the 
company, citing extended valuation due to potentially overly 
optimistic sales forecasts for the new Xbox video-game box. The 
analyst blamed the current economic malaise as well as 
competition from Japanese video-game manufacturers for his 
concerns.

Shares of Amgen Inc. were higher in premarket activity after the 
company revised its estimated earnings growth rate upward, 
saying that sales of its new Aranesp anemia drug and Kineret 
arthritis treatment will push up its earnings growth rate to 20% 
in 2002, on the heels of 10%-12% growth this year. The company 
also reaffirmed its previous targets of compound sales and 
earnings growth in the low 20% range for the years 2001 through 
2005. Amgen said that the forecasts excluded potential profits 
that would be realized if either Aranesp or a longer-acting form 
of its current Neupogen drug were approved for use in cancer 
patients.

Communications chipmaker Analog Devices Inc. reported fiscal 4Q 
profits excluding items of $0.14 per share, ahead of the lowered 
First Call consensus estimate of $0.12 per share. Sales for the 
quarter fell 47% to $423.3 million, as companies such as Nortel 
Networks (NT,8.07,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.05,f1) curbed new 
orders amid sluggish demand in the telecom industry. Looking to 
the fiscal 1Q, ADI said that sales will likely fall 5% below 4Q, 
and it expects earnings to come in at the low end of the 
Street's estimates.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Treasuries retreated following this morning's 
better-than-expected jobless claims report. According to the 
Labor Department, first-time claims fell 15,000 to 427,000 for 
the week ended Nov. 17 from the prior week's downwardly revised 
442,000 level. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were looking for 
an increase in claims to 450,000. The four-week moving average 
of claims fell to 454,250 and continuing claims through the week 
ended Nov. 10 fell to 3,734,000. The drop in initial claims 
reflects potential firming in the job market, but continuous 
claims, while improving, still remain near an 18-year high. 
Traders will also be looking to this morning's approximately 
9:45 a.m. EST release of the University of Michigan's consumer 
sentiment index for further direction.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

A fresh eight-year low in the October German IFO business 
sentiment index and a European Union Commission downgrade of 
economic growth prospects capped gains in European bourses. The 
IFO index fell to a worse-than-expected 84.7 reading from 
September's 85.0 level, fueling speculation that Germany may not 
be able to avoid a recession. Adding to the worries, the 
European Union Commission slashed its euro-zone growth forecasts 
to 1.6% for 2001 and 1.3% for 2002 from previous estimates of 
2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. In equities news, Dutch banking 
company ING Groep NV (ING,26) posted a smaller-than-expected 
drop in 3Q net profit to 901 million euros and reiterated 
full-year guidance. The euro was lower against the dollar 
following the German IFO report, while the Bloomberg European 
500 index was up 0.2% as of 8:54 a.m. EST.

Asian stocks were mixed, but Japan's Nikkei-225 index closed up 
0.8% on strength in banking shares. Asahi Bank (ASIBY,7.75) 
reported that it disposed of a larger-than-expected amount of 
non-performing loans, sparking optimism that more companies in 
the sector may follow suit. The yen was lower against the dollar 
after Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami intimated that 
injecting more money into the banking system would do little to 
stimulate the economy.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 9:14 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was 1.5 points lower while the Nasdaq 100 index 
was down 2.5 points. The December DJIA futures contract was down 
15 points and the January crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX 
were up $0.20 at $19.35/barrel.

IWC RULES IN EMPLOYERS FAVOR ON EMPLOYEES PAY STATUS DURING TEMPORARY
PLANT SHUTDOWN

At the October 29th hearing in San Jose, the Industrial Welfare
Commission (IWC) approved an amendment of the Statement as to the Basis
of Wage Order 5, rejecting the controversial letter written by Mr. Miles
Locker, former Chief Counsel, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement
(DLSE), that prohibited any deductions from exempt employee's salary in
increments of less than one-month during temporary plant shut down.  The
amendment makes it clear that the IWC believes that employers are
required to pay exempt employees their full predetermined salary for any
week in which any work is performed instead of any month in which any
work is performed with limited exceptions.  That's good news for
employers.

CMTA, along with other employer representatives, testified at the
commission hearing requesting that the IWC clarify whether California
businesses should continue to follow the federal rules regarding exempt
employees salary deductions. Under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) the salary deduction for exempt employees is measured in weeks
and not months as opined by Mr. Locker under California law.  Locker's
much maligned interpretation was believed to be based on AB 60 (Chapter
134, Statutes of 1999) ? a bill that made sweeping changes to California
wage and hour laws.  However, AB 60 did not contain any language that
specifically prohibited wage deductions from exempt employees in
increments of less than one month.  On the contrary, Section 515 (c) of
the Labor Code specifically provides that ?for purposes of this section
'full-time employment'  means employment in which an employee is
employed for 40 hours per week.?   In CMTA's opinion, this language
clearly provides that salaries may be paid weekly, clearly comporting
with the FLSA that permits weekly deduction.

Advocacy on this issue is not yet over.  While the amendment clearly
indicates where the commission stands on the issue, according to
Commission Chair, Bill Dombrowski, (amendment passed on a 4-1 vote) it
only applies to Wage Order 5 (Public Housekeeping) and not to the other
14 orders. The IWC is authorized to amend without hearings the Statement
as to the Basis of any wage order that is open.  Wage Order 5 was the
only order open at the October 29 meeting so the commission did not have
the authority to clarify the issue by revising all of the wage orders.
Also important to employers is that the IWC voted to set an
investigation hearing with regard to the issues set forth in the Locker
letter, and requested that the commission staff establish a schedule for
completing that investigation and amending all of the wage orders to
reflect the commission's position on this issue, in as short a time as
possible.

The commission's action is good news for California employers especially
when they are about to enter the most frequent periods of temporary shut
downs, the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Employers are facing
many economic challenges in a slowing economy and flexibility is needed
to improve efficiencies and control cost if employers are to remain
competitive and minimize layoffs. Employers are already faced with
high-energy costs and double-digit cost increases in health care and
workers? compensation insurance premiums that only seem to grow.

CMTA believes that the commission's ruling brings clarity and reason to
the issue, indicating that temporary plant closures in California will
continue to follow the federal rules concerning exempt employees salary
deductions.


DTSC STEPS UP PRESSURE ON MERCURY

The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) recently
released a comprehensive report on mercury, a metal that is ubiquitous
in the environment and can be found in manufacturing processes and
consumer products.  Examples cited in the report include ash,
contaminated soil, cement manufacturing, sewage sludge, pharmaceuticals,
paint, pesticides, electrical switches, fluorescent lamps and
batteries.  Mercury is the subject of increasing regulatory attention
due to the fact that certain forms are highly toxic and known to
bioaccumulate (i.e., concentrate in organisms).  DTSC?s report examines
mercury uses, health effects, behavior in the environment and regulatory
options.

The report recommends regulating all mercury-containing waste, whether
present in manufacturing process wastes, consumer products or naturally
occurring mercury liberated in mining or construction activities, as
hazardous waste.  This broad-brush listing approach would be a dramatic
departure from the current concentration-based regulatory scheme, and
raises numerous policy questions concerning the extent of DTSC?s
regulatory authority, the point at which a material or product is
determined to be a waste, collection and handling requirements and class
1 (hazardous waste) disposal capacity.  This approach also calls into
question the future viability of existing recycling programs where
postconsumer recyclable materials may contain trace quantities of
mercury.  Presumably, consumers, haulers and recyclers would find
themselves in the business of managing hazardous waste.

In advancing this recommendation, the report fails to assess the
anticipated environmental and human health benefit and the associated
cost to consumers and the regulated community.  Moreover, it fails to
address at least one major source of mercury exposure ? legacy waste
from past placer mining activities.  While DTSC acknowledges that legacy
mining waste is one of the largest contributors of mercury to the
state's environment, the report does not contemplate strategies to
mitigate this source.

These issues should be addressed in a subsequent iteration of the
report, before DTSC initiates any regulatory action.  Now more than
ever, the state must ensure that its regulatory initiatives make wise
use of limited resources to target the sources that drive public health
risks and environmental exposures.


MORE BAD NEWS FROM FINANCE: MANUFACTURING JOB LOSSES GROW

According to just-released figures from the California Department of
Finance, a clearer picture of the California economy is emerging
subsequent to September 11, 2001. It appears California suffered less
than the nation as a whole, with the state's 4,300 drop in nonfarm jobs
amounting to only 1 percent of the nationwide loss of 415,000 jobs. The
Manufacturing sector continued to take the brunt in California losing
over 10,000 jobs in October, now totaling over 76,000 lost jobs during
the last 12 months.

   * Industry employment estimates for October show a decline in all
     private industry sectors, with the exception of a small gain in
     finance, insurance and real estate.  The state appears, however, to
     be faring better than the nation as a whole.
   * The impact of the September 11 attacks is difficult to gauge.  Air
     transportation lost 4,300 jobs, which is about 10% of the national
     losses.  Hotels shed 3,500 jobs, which represent about 8% of the
     national loss.  Eating and drinking places actually added 4,600
     jobs, even though the nation as a whole dropped 37,000.
     Transportation services, which include travel agents, lost 300 jobs
     in California, compared to 12,000 nationally.
   * Manufacturing employment dropped 10,900 in October with weakness in
     both high-tech industries?computers, electronics, aerospace, and
     instruments?and in construction-related fields.  Chemicals posted
     the only gain in October.  Nationally, manufacturing dropped
     142,000 jobs.
   * Local government employment rose 18,200 during the month, after
     dropping more than 22,000 in September, reflecting difficulties in
     seasonally adjusting beginning of school year figures.
   * On a year-over-year basis, total industry employment grew by
     103,200 or 0.7 percent, while the nation lost 378,000 jobs, a drop
     of 0.3 percent.  Wholesale and retail trade added the most jobs,
     41,800.  Services were not far behind, adding 40,800 jobs.
     Manufacturing employment has fallen by 76,600 jobs over the year,
     with over half of the losses coming from the state's high tech
     sectors.  The motion picture industry lost 2,000 jobs, in the
     aftermath of heavy strike-hedge activity in the first half of the
     year.
   * California's unemployment rate rose 0.3 percent to 5.7 percent in
     October, with the unemployment rolls growing by 47,400.
     Nationally, the jobless rate jumped 0.5 percent to 5.4 percent.

    Revenue Update

   * Preliminary General Fund Agency Cash for October was $220 below the
     2001 Budget Act Forecast of $4.63 billion. Year-to-date, revenues
     are $827 million below expectations. These revenue figures reflect

REPORTS ON NATURAL GAS

Rumblings of a looming natural gas ?problem? are surfacing, however
there is little expectation that this ?problem? will expand into a
crisis of electricity proportions.  Legislation was passed in 2001
requiring the California Public Utilities Commission to look at and
report long-term natural gas forecasts.  Preliminary studies have been
completed, and likely will be released in the next week or so.

The California Energy Commission also has released a draft report that
evaluates the interrelationships between natural gas and electricity and
the price of energy resources.  This draft report is available online at
http://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/.

STOCKS LOWER IN PRE-HOLIDAY SESSION

U.S. equities are trading lower midday amid mildly positive 
economic data and mixed equity news. Jobless data and consumer 
sentiment figures released this morning were slightly better 
than expected, while biotech firms Amgen (AMGN,58,f1) and 
Guidant (GDT,51,f2) reported positive news and Chiron Corp. 
(CHIR,46,f1) reported negative news. U.S. Treasuries are posting 
declines mid-session and European markets are mostly lower late 
in the day.

As of 11:54 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 
0.8%, while the Nasdaq is down 1.1%. The S&P 500 Index is down 
0.8%. Computer related and communication equipment stocks are 
leading the decliners, while drugs and medical products are 
pacing the advancers.

Shares of Amgen Inc. are higher after the biotech giant 
increased its earnings growth forecast to 20% in 2002, on the 
heels of 10%-12% growth this year, citing stronger sales of its 
new Aranesp anemia drug and Kineret arthritis treatment. The 
company also reaffirmed its previous target for compound sales 
and earnings growth in the low 20% range for the 2001-2005 
period. In other biotech news, Chiron Corp. is lower following 
news that one of its drugs yielded disappointing results. The 
company stated that Tifacogin, its severe sepsis drug, failed to 
reduce deaths in final stage trials as hoped.

Guidant Corp. is higher after the maker of heart devices 
reported that a study indicated its implantable defibrillators 
reduced deaths among heart attack survivors by 30%. The company 
said it plans to ask the FDA for expanded approval for the 
devices.

Communications-chip maker Analog Devices Inc. (ADI,41,f2) 
reported fiscal 4Q profits excluding items of $0.14 per share, 
ahead of the lowered First Call estimate of $0.12 per share. 
Sales for the quarter fell 47% to $423.3 million, as customers 
curbed new orders amid sluggish demand in the telecom industry. 
Going forward, ADI said that fiscal 1Q sales would likely fall 
5% below 4Q levels and it expects earnings at the low end of the 
Street's estimates. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasuries were lower following the release of this 
morning's economic data. The University of Michigan consumer 
sentiment index for November came in at 83.9, higher than 
Bloomberg's 83.5 estimate and the 82.7 reading in October. The 
current conditions index rose to 95.3 from 94.0 in October, 
while the expectations index increased to 76.6 from October's 
75.5 reading, reflecting slightly improved consumer optimism.

In an earlier release, the Labor Department reported that 
initial jobless claims fell 15,000 to 427,000 for the week ended 
Nov. 17, from the prior week's downwardly revised 442,000 level. 
Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires were expecting an increase to 
450,000. The four-week moving average of claims dropped to 
454,250 and continuing claims through the week ended Nov. 10 
fell to 3,734,000. The drop in first-time claims reflects 
potential firming in the job market, but continuing claims, 
while improving, still remain near an 18-year high.

North American-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment 
posted a 5% rise in orders to $651.1 million in October 2001 
from September's revised $619.2 million and a book-to-bill ratio 
of 0.71, up from the previous month's 0.64 reading. This 
reflects $71 in new orders for every $100 of product shipped. 
Although the situation is slightly improved, Semiconductor 
Equipment and Materials International CEO Stanley Myers 
commented that, ""While the decline in orders has abated, the 
average monthly shipment figure continues to weaken, and there 
is no appreciable indication of a near-term trend reversal.""

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are mostly lower late in the session, with the 
Bloomberg European 500 index down 0.3% as of 11:54 a.m. EST. 
Telecom and media issues led the decliners, while banks and 
pharmaceuticals paced the advancers. On the economic front, the 
German IFO business sentiment index recorded a fresh 8-year low, 
falling to a worse-than-expected 84.7 reading from September's 
85.0 level and fueling speculation that Germany may not be able 
to avoid a recession. Adding to the worries, the European Union 
Commission slashed its euro-zone growth forecasts to 1.6% for 
2001 and 1.3% for 2002, from previous estimates of 2.8% and 
2.9%, respectively. The euro was trading near 3-1/2 month lows 
versus the U.S. dollar, mainly on the weak economic news out of 
Europe.

for Wednesday, November 21, 2001

Brick-and-mortar cuts hurt e-tailers

Price discounts by traditional retailers are likely to reduce 
sales for online retailers, according to the Conference Board, a 
nonprofit research group.

""Bargains are not as prevalent because offline stores are 
offering discounts,"" said the board's director, Lynn Franco. 
""The incentive to shop on the Web is not there."" Her group 
conducted a holiday shopping survey and found 22% of its 
respondents indicated they plan to make online purchases, 
compared to 21% a year ago.

Another study of shopping plans, by Chicago-based consulting 
firm Accenture, found a sharp disinterest in online shopping. 
Forty-three percent said they planned to shop less online this 
year than last, while 23% said they would spend more through the 
Web. The big draw for online shoppers was convenience.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
China shutters Internet bars

Chinese authorities have closed almost 20% of the country's 
94,000 Internet bars. They failed to install software to block 
access to Web sites the government considers pornographic or 
subversive, the Associated Press reported. ""Some youths will 
submerge themselves for long periods, playing unhealthy games 
and adversely affecting their development as normal students,"" 
according to a Shanghai newspaper. The newspaper estimates about 
27 million Chinese access the Web, 4.5 million through the 
""bars,"" often one-room shops with PCs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Trib lets fingers do the advertising

The Chicago Tribune's Web site now allows consumers to create 
classified ads that appear both online and in the newspaper. The 
feature is available from a button labeled ""Place an Ad"" on 
chicagotribune.com. ""People are now accustomed to doing business 
on the Web and through this innovation we address the needs of 
both our private and commercial customers,"" said Jane Migely, 
director of classified advertising.

Editor's note: Due to the Thanksgiving Day holiday, Internet 
Daily will not be sent on Nov. 22 and 23.

<font SIZE=""-2"" FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" color=""999999"">November 22nd 2001<br>From The Economist print edition
</font>

<br><br><br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>The good oil</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Oil-industry consolidation continues, as <b>Phillips Petroleum</b> and <b>Conoco</b> announced a $15 billion all-share merger. The new company, to be called ConocoPhillips, is likely to be the sixth-biggest producer in the world, based on revenues.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34881_6659355_2_80010922_60368779_1_60"">See article: Minor majors</a>
<img src=""http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif"" hspace=""2"" width=""17"" height=""10"" alt=""E+""></font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Normandy Mining</b>, of Australia, wooed by rival bids from America's <b>Newmont Mining</b> and South Africa's<b> AngloGold</b>, rejected AngloGold's all-share bid. This paves the way for a possible sweetened counter-offer from AngloGold, the world's second-largest gold producer. </font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Enron's</b> financial turmoil worsened. But the Texan energy giant managed to put off repayment of some debts until mid-December. Enron's shares plunged to ten-year lows, casting greater doubt over its plans to be taken over in a rescue bid by smaller rival <b>Dynegy</b>.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Three <b>European steel makers</b>, Aceralia, Arbed and Usinor, patched up differences that had threatened their plans to merge, by agreeing to reduce Usinor's stake in the combined entity. The new company will be the world's biggest steel maker.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Optimism at last</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average </b>has climbed by nearly 20% above its lows on September 21st, leading some optimists to announce the emergence of a new bull market. The index came within 23 points of the 10,000 mark before falling back.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34880_6659355_2_80010922_60368779_1_5f"">See article: Messages of hope?</a>
</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Brand names got a boost in Europe. The European Court of Justice handed a victory to jeans maker <b>Levi Strauss</b> when it ruled that sales of so-called &#8220;parallel imports&#8221; from outside the European Union's jurisdiction were allowed only with the consent of the trademark owner. The decision ends Levi's three-year battle with Tesco, a British supermarket chain, that sold cut-price Levi's jeans imported from the United States.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">American <b>industrial production</b> fell for the 13th straight month, the longest continuous decline since the second world war. Other indicators were more optimistic: the Conference Board's index of leading indicators rose by 0.3% in October, raising hopes that the widely expected recession might not last long.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""> </font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Schmidtbank</b>, a 170-year-old family-owned German bank, was rescued from some decidedly modern investments by a consortium of bigger peers, including Deutsche Bank, <font size=""-1"">HVB</font> Group, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank. Schmidtbank has racked up losses from Consors, an online broker, as well as from bad loans to Germany's <i>Mittelstand</i> companies.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>French connections</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Shares in <b>Bull</b>, the troubled French computer company, shot up when its chairman, Guy de Panafieu, resigned. The French government pledged <i>euro</i>100m ($88m) to the company, though the European Commission, which is strongly opposed to state subsidies, may yet raise objections to the plan.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The chief of <b>Barclays'</b> French operations was questioned by magistrates in Paris as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering between France and Israel. Other banks under scrutiny include <font size=""-1"">BRED</font>, and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Marseillaise de Cr&eacute;dit, owned by <font size=""-1"">HSBC</font>.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The European Commission levied a <i>euro</i>855m ($750) fine, the largest in its history, against <b>Roche </b>and <b>BASF</b>, and six other companies, for price-fixing in the market for vitamins. Two years ago, both companies were fined by antitrust regulators in America, and a Roche executive was jailed for four months.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Percy Barnevik</b>, the Swedish businessman who more or less created <font size=""-1"">ABB</font>, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, is to step down as non-executive chairman. Mr Barnevik said his departure would give the company's new management team a clear mandate of their own.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Love boats</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Royal Caribbean Cruises</b> and <b>P&amp;O Princess Cruises</b>, respectively the world's second- and third-largest cruise lines, agreed to merge in a bid to ride out the global economic storm. The deal may frustrate the ambitions of <b>Carnival Cruise Lines</b>, the industry leader, which has made previous overtures to P&amp;O Princess in a failed attempt to expand its European operations.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>KPN</b>, the Dutch telecoms company, said it would issue <i>euro</i>5 billion ($4.4 billion ) in shares at a 50% discount to the current price, to help it reduce a massive debt load acquired to purchase third-generation mobile-phone licences. </font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">A slump in demand has cost jobs at <b>Alcoa</b>, the world's largest aluminium producer, which announced plans to sack 6,500 workers around the world. The company is forecasting a 4.7% drop in aluminium demand this year, the worst in 20 years.</font></p>

Morning Market View(TM) 
for Friday, November 23, 2001
as of 9:30AM EST
Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research


STOCKS MIXED IN TURKEY DAZE

Stocks were poised to open mixed on this shortened trading day 
as America awakens from its traditional L-tryptophan stupor amid 
very little corporate or economic news. The National Bureau of 
Economic Research may declare the U.S. economy is in a 
recession, but there is a silver lining. Oil and oil-related 
shares fell overnight as Russia continues to rebuff OPEC 
overtures, driving European bourses lower.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the NBER is meeting today 
and may declare that the longest U.S. economic expansion since 
World War II ended in March, when employment figures signaled 
that a recession may have begun. While a general rule of thumb 
for defining a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative 
Gross Domestic Product growth, the NBER defines a recession in a 
more subjective manner, utilizing key economic indicators.

If a recession did indeed start in March, that could actually be 
a positive development, that is if history is any guide. Of 
course there are no guarantees that the economy will stick to 
historical norms, but the average recession since WWII lasted 
for about 10.5 months, with the longest slump spanning 16 
months. That could mean that a recovery is just around the 
corner. Few economic indicators point to this scenario at this 
time, nor do earnings forecasts, but Ned Davis research shows 
that the markets have historically bottomed during a recession 
roughly five months before the economy and about ten months 
ahead of an earnings recovery. And there is a lot of monetary 
and fiscal stimulus in the pipeline to support a recovery soon. 
So, cheer up... the malls are opening early today!

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Prices across the yield curve rose in early trading as 
Treasuries remain volatile, following last week's wild ride and 
oil prices fell overnight. Oil prices were higher earlier after 
Norway agreed to cut oil production, succumbing to OPEC pressure 
to cap global production limits. However, Russia once again 
rebuffed OPEC's threat of a price war if non-OPEC producers do 
not cut production by a total of 500,000 barrels per day, 
sending oil sharply lower. Russia said that it would cut output 
by just 50,000 bpd, but it wants to wait until early next year 
to discuss deeper cuts.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

After trading higher earlier in the session, oil-related shares 
led Bloomberg's European 500 Index down 1.2%, as of 8:55 a.m. 
EST. The euro rose versus the U.S. dollar after it was reported 
that French Gross Domestic Product rose 0.5% in 3Q, more than 
the 0.3% rise forecast according to Bloomberg, and German 
inflation remained tame in November. The British pound fell 
after UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reignited talk of joining the 
European Union, a move that Blair maintains would benefit the UK 
economy but may require a weaker pound to gain entry.

Japan's markets were closed overnight for a holiday, but other 
Asian markets were generally higher. The yen fell versus the 
dollar after the Financial Times reported that the U.S. would 
support a Japanese plan to buy more U.S. securities to help 
weaken the yen.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:55 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was 1.7 points lower while the Nasdaq 100 index 
was up 3.5 points. The December DJIA futures contract was down 
13 points.

Hi everyone,

Hope you're having a nice Thanksgiving break. Just a friendly reminder on the following (again, if you plan to attend, please respond to me directly and indicate which evening):  


Fellow Evening Haasians,

Who are these so called account managers, Rich, Jenny and Mark? What do they do? How can we leverage off their expertise and they, ours? Do they have specific company
contacts? Where can they be found? Will the ubiquitous pizza be served to entice you to attend? Strong possibility. Will I have to sign up on Bear Tracks? No. How can attending benefit me? It's up to you.

To answer these questions and many more, we will be scheduling during -

Mon, Nov. 26 during the break (i.e., 7:30 - 8:15) in C125 and
Thu, Dec. 6 during the break as well in the Career Center Conference Room (S420)

an informational session with the account managers.

Here's a description that Rich Wong, the financial services account manager prepared:

""The Haas Career Center staff includes 3 account managers that
can be a valuable resource to those that are exploring job or career
direction changes. Their role is to be the primary liaison for recruiters
in their specific industry sectors, being the one-stop shop point person
for companies interested in connecting with Haas MBA students.  They
cover a full spectrum of responsibilities from the logistics of setting up
presentations and interviews to establishing contacts and providing
strategic guidance to recruiters (including both hiring managers as well
as University Recruiting reps within human resource departments).
Through this activity, they gain insights into their company/industry
focus that they are happy to share with Haas students, John Morel,
and the other career advisors in the Haas Career Center.""

Feel free to contact them regarding questions on companies and industries
that they represent.  Conversely, please provide them with any valuable
contacts that you have in current/former employers that might help them aid your
schoolmates to find employment opportunities. They are located in the Recruitment Center
(S330 by the ATM machine) and their contact information is as follows:

Mark Friedfeld - Financial Services (Investment and Commercial Banking, Real
Estate, Venture Capital)
friedfel@haas.berkeley.edu/510-642-6588

Jenny Rowe - Consulting, Consumer Products, Healthcare/Biotech/Medical

rowe@haas.berkeley.edu/510-643-4212

Rich Wong - Technology, Entertainment - rwong@haas.berkeley.edu/510-643-4211

If you plan to attend, please respond to me directly and indicate which evening.

Best regards, Albert Demery

Internet Daily 
for Friday, November 23, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Amazon.com back to normal

Amazon.com said its customers have ordered almost 9 million 
items in the past two weeks, ""sending a clear message: it's back 
to shopping as usual this holiday season."" Items related to 
Harry Potter account for 20% of the top sellers, and sales of 
DVD players are 75% ahead of last year.

AOL France sees flat-rate approval

Internet users in France may not have to count the minutes and 
the francs much longer. The chief of AOL France, a unit of AOL 
Time Warner's America Online, was reported Friday to be 
expecting the country's regulators to allow Internet service 
providers to offer flat-rate pricing. Currently, Web users pay 
by the minute. ""I think it will be a battle won,"" AOL France's 
Stephane Treppoz said, according to Dow Jones. But he does not 
expect much of an impact in the marketplace. Troppez, speaking 
at a broadband industry meeting in Montpelier, France, said, 
""Users don't feel they need to move to broadband, they're 
satisfied with low band."" He did point out however that when 
flat-rate pricing was offered in the U.K. a year ago, average 
daily online use jumped from 20 minutes to an hour.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Lycos workers ordered home for Christmas

The almost 800 U.S.-based employees of Terra Lycos are required 
to take five days off between Dec. 24 and Dec. 31, either as 
vacation or unpaid leave. The move is aimed at cutting costs, 
according to a report from Dow Jones in Madrid, Spain. A company 
spokesman said only key personnel will stay on the job.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
You've got pink slips

Eastman Kodak's PhotoNet, which provided services to AOL Time 
Warner's America Online, is being shut down. About 135 employees 
in Israel and the U.S. are being laid off by the shutdown of the 
PictureVision unit, according to Israel's Business Arena 
publication. There was no indication AOL's ""You've Got Pictures"" 
service would be affected by the move. Kodak said it would 
consider transferring key employees in its Israel office to its 
New York headquarters.

Hi Jeff:

I'm not sure if hiring is an issue these days for you, but I wanted to let
you know that Jim Bushnell and I will be again teaching a course at
Berkeley this spring called ""Energy Market Strategies and Policies.""  The
course is cross-listed between the Haas School of Business and the Energy
& Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley.

The course is currently limited to 42 students, but it is already
over-subscribed, so we are trying to move it to a larger classroom. We'll
have mostly MBA students from Haas, but also about a dozen masters
students from ERG. There are also usually at least a few PhD students.
The students in the class are were very smart -- many of them
already have experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the
course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any
energy-related organization that they would join.  You can see a copy of
last year's course syllabus at
 http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste/EnergyMarketsSyllabus.pdf

Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
employment starting as early as May.  If you have openings that you would
like to advertise to these students, please let me know.  We will be
setting up a webpage with job announcements in energy-related
organizations.  If you send me a job description (or the URL for it), I
can add it to the webpage.

Talk to you soon,
Severin

NO HOLIDAY HANGOVER FOR U.S. STOCKS

Equity index futures were suggesting a positive open, continuing 
the trend from overseas on the heels of the recent upside 
momentum in U.S. stocks. Although economic and corporate news 
was sparse following the holiday weekend, early 
post-Thanksgiving results in the retailing sector, including 
record sales at Wal-Mart Stores (WMT,56,f2&f4), hinted that 
consumer spending may be more resilient than previously 
expected. According to TeleCheck Services Inc., same store sales 
in the U.S. rose 2.4% on Friday. Treasuries were virtually 
unchanged in the absence of any economic data.

Discount retailing giant Wal-Mart reported a single-day record 
for sales of $1.25 billion on Friday after its Holiday Blitz 
promotion attracted bargain hunters to its stores. Rival K-Mart 
(KM,6.85) also said it saw a strong response as compared to the 
year-ago post-Thanksgiving period. However, most of the holiday 
buying appeared to be narrow in scope, with shoppers favoring 
the deep-discount retailers over department stores. In related 
news, Pier One Imports (PIR,13.97) raised its same-store sales 
forecast for November to an increase of 6%-8% and increased its 
3Q earnings forecast to $0.21-$0.23 per share from the previous 
$0.19-$0.21 per share guidance.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were virtually unchanged as traders await economic data 
scheduled for release later in the week. Treasury Secretary Paul 
O'Neill hinted that the U.S. economy was on its way to a 
recovery, citing Friday's increase in post-Thanksgiving sales as 
compared to a year-ago as a sign that consumer spending remains 
intact. Although early reports reflected a strong retailing 
picture over the holiday weekend, tomorrow's consumer confidence 
report for November, due at 10:00 a.m. EST, should shed more 
light on consumer sentiment. Existing home sales are also slated 
for a 10:00 a.m. EST release.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European bourses kicked the week off on a positive note led by 
strength in telecom equipment and computer-related stocks. Nokia 
(NOK,24,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.55,f1) shares got a boost 
after Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for worldwide 
wireless phone unit sales by 5.4% to 390 million phones in 2001 
and by 3.6% to 435 million phones in 2002. Siemens AG (SI,60) 
was also higher after the company broached the subject of a wage 
freeze for up to 40,000 of its employees in a cost-cutting move. 
The euro advanced against the U.S. dollar, after falling to a 3 
1/2 month low last week. The Bloomberg European 500 index was up 
0.3% as of 8:52 a.m. EST.

Asian markets were also broadly higher with Japan's Nikkei 225 
index closing up 3.4% on the heels of Friday's positive momentum 
in U.S. stocks. Export stocks got a boost from Wal-Mart's 
favorable post-Thanksgiving sales results and technology stocks 
were widely higher. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM,15.70) upped its 
2001 pre-tax profit guidance and sales forecast by 55% and 2.8% 
respectively, due to a recent pick-up in demand for its 
products. The yen rose against the dollar as Bank of Japan 
Governor Masaru Hayami said that the increased purchase of 
foreign currency-denominated bonds would have a limited economic 
impact, bucking speculation that Japan's central bank may adopt 
this particular strategy to weaken the Japanese currency.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:52 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was 0.5 points lower (2 points above fair value), 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was up 6.5 points (6 points above 
fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was down 12 
points (8 points above fair value), and the January crude oil 
futures traded on the NYMEX were down $0.21 at $18.75/barrel.

STOCKS SHED EARLIER GAINS 

U.S. stocks are mixed but generally lower following a report by 
the National Bureau of Economic Research indicating that the 
U.S. officially fell into a recession in March of this year, 
citing a plethora of economic indicators.  Although economic and 
corporate news was sparse following the holiday weekend, early 
post-Thanksgiving results in the retailing sector, including 
record sales at Wal-Mart Stores (WMT,55,f2&f4), hinted that 
consumer spending may be more resilient than previously 
expected. Lucent Technologies (LU,7.93,f2) is suffering from 
analyst downgrades. Treasuries were higher as bottom-fishers 
stepped up in the absence of any salient economic data and 
European markets are mixed late in the day.

As of 11:55 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 
0.4%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.7%. The S&P 500 index is down 
0.1%. Energy-related and communication equipment stocks are 
leading the decliners, while semiconductor, wireless and auto 
issues are among the best performers.

Shares of Wal-Mart were lower even as the discount retailing 
giant reported a single-day record for sales of $1.25 billion on 
Friday after its Holiday Blitz promotion attracted 
bargain-hunters to its stores. Most of the holiday buying 
appeared to be narrow in scope, with shoppers favoring the 
deep-discount retailers over department stores. According to 
TeleCheck Services Inc., same store sales in the U.S. rose 2.4% 
on Friday.  In related news, Pier One Imports (PIR,14.41) got a 
boost after it raised its same-store sales forecast for November 
to an increase of 6%-8% and increased its 3Q earnings forecast 
to $0.21-$0.23 per share from the previous $0.19-$0.21 per share 
guidance.

Shares of Lucent Technologies were under pressure after the 
communication networking company was downgraded by analysts at 
two major brokerage houses. An ABN AMRO analyst lowered his 2002 
earnings forecast to a loss of $0.53 per share from the previous 
$0.39 per share loss estimate, while an analyst at Morgan 
Stanley cited capital spending cuts and regulatory issues as 
concerns.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds are higher across the curve as bargain-hunters stepped in 
following the recent declines in Treasuries. Earlier, NBER said 
that the 10-year U.S. economic expansion officially ended in 
March of this year and a recession has officially ensued. 
Uplifting comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President 
William Poole that the U.S. is starting to display signs of a 
recovery did little to stem the upward momentum in Treasuries, 
despite Poole's reference to rising equity prices, a firming 
housing market, and stronger retail sales.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are mixed late in the session, shedding earlier 
gains as U.S. markets meandered in and out of positive 
territory. The Bloomberg European 500 index is down 0.07% as of 
11:55 a.m. EST. Telecom equipment and mining stocks are the 
best-performing issues, while energy stocks are pacing the 
decliners. Nokia (NOK,25,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.74,f1) shares 
were higher after Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for 
worldwide wireless phone unit sales by 5.4% to 390 million 
phones in 2001 and by 3.6% to 435 million phones in 2002. In 
other equity news, Deutsche Lufthansa AG's (DLAKY,14.00) CEO 
said that he sees ""no signs of recovery"" in passenger traffic, 
though he does anticipate an eventual pick up in demand. The 
euro remained in positive territory against the dollar but 
retreated from earlier highs. Crude oil is trading lower as 
Russia continues to act defiant toward any meaningful production 
cut, choosing to wait until Dec. 10 instead to plan production 
for 2002.

AWARD-WINNING ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA TO HOLD TEACHING RESIDENCY
The Grammy Award-winning Orpheus Chamber Orchestra will hold a one-day 
teaching residency at the Haas School on November 29th.  Orpheus, the only 
chamber orchestra in the world that consistently rehearses, performs, and 
records without a conductor, has garnered attention from the corporate 
sector for its unique approaches to creativity, innovation, and 
self-management.

Orpheus will showcase its innovative approach to leadership for of a group 
of Haas MBA students on Thursday from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the 
International House auditorium. Tickets to the event were awarded to MBA 
students through a lottery process. Morgan Stanley is sponsoring the event 
at Haas. The firm also sponsored an Orpheus residency at Hitotsubashi 
University in Tokyo in June 2001.

The program will include presentations by Dean Laura Tyson; Harvey Seifter, 
executive director of Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and author of ""Leadership 
Ensemble""; lecturer Terry Pearce; and David Pottruck, co-CEO of Charles 
Schwab. John McGeehan, managing director and chief administrative officer 
for Morgan Stanley Japan Limited will also be in attendance.

Central to the distinctive personality of Orpheus is its unusual process of 
sharing and rotating leadership roles. The ""Orpheus Process"" is built on 
individual responsibility, shared leadership, and workplace democracy. The 
process has enabled the orchestra to unleash the talent, vision, 
creativity, and leadership potential of each member of the group.

For every work, an elected committee of musicians selects a concertmaster 
and each instrumental section chooses a representative.  These chosen 
representatives (the ""core group"") are responsible for forming the initial 
concept of the piece and developing an overall interpretive approach to the 
music before the entire orchestra comes together to rehearse.  The core 
also structures the rehearsal process for the entire orchestra, which 
provides clear leadership while insuring that every member has a real stake 
in the artistic outcome of every piece performed by the orchestra. The 
results of the process have produced 28 years of sustained excellence at 
the highest level of international accomplishment.

The main focus of the residency at Haas will be to demonstrate the Orpheus 
Process in action as the orchestra rehearses the first movement of Haydn's 
Symphony No. 63 in C Major in ""real time,"" showing by example their work 
process from core preparations to final product. The applications of the 
Orpheus Process to the business world will be framed in the introduction 
and reinforced through a question-and-answer and discussion period with the 
students and presenters.

VERY POPULAR ""FUNDAMENTALS OF BUSINESS"" COURSE OPENS HAAS TO BERKELEY 
GRADUATE STUDENTS
For the first time, the Haas School is offering a graduate-level business 
course specifically designed for non-business school students at UC 
Berkeley who want exposure to fundamental knowledge of management and 
business. ""Fundamentals of Business"" (BA 296-10) will introduce Berkeley 
graduate students to the basics of business.

So far, the course appears quite popular, with almost every seat taken 
during the pre-enrollment process. Of the 102 students currently 
pre-enrolled, the largest segment (18 students) comes from the College of 
Engineering. The remainder come from a variety of graduate programs at 
Berkeley.

""For years there has been high demand for Haas courses outside the school,"" 
says Andy Shogan, associate dean for instruction. ""Graduate students don't 
have time to take several business courses to learn management, finance, 
and marketing. This course will satisfy that demand and expose the students 
to more topics.""

Fundamentals of Business is a broad survey course for graduate students 
designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the study of business 
and modern management techniques such as data gathering, analysis, and 
decision-making. The class meets in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium on 
Wednesdays from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.

The format of the course is three five-week modules taught by a team of 
instructors with different functional areas of expertise. The modules are:
    ""Managing People in Organizations"" taught by Nancy Euske,
    ""Accounting and Finance"" taught by Victor Stanton,
    ""Delighting Customers: Marketing and Strategy"" taught by David Robinson.

At the end of each of the three modules, there will be an exam on the 
following Monday. The course is open to graduate students only from 
departments other than the Haas School. No prerequisite coursework is 
required, but a familiarity with basic economics is helpful. For more 
information visit http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~robinson/BA296/.

Haas also offers an undergraduate business survey course, BA 10, which is a 
prerequisite for the business major.

  HAAS JOINS IN LAUNCHING OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO INCREASE WOMEN IN 
BUSINESS LEADERSHIP
A new national nonprofit organization designed to increase the number of 
women business owners and business leaders was announced on November 6 
during the group's first board meeting at the University of Michigan 
Business School. Ilse Evans, executive director of MBA Admissions and 
Career Services, and David Downes, director of the Full-Time MBA program, 
are founding board members.

The organization, whose name and headquarters have yet to be determined, is 
an alliance of educational institutions, businesses, and nonprofit groups. 
The organization will work to increase women's access to education and 
business networks, support women financially in their business education, 
raise awareness of the impact women can make on business and society, and 
encourage and support research on relevant topics.

""One of the key barriers to access to business education is the lack of 
awareness and knowledge women have about the value and flexibility of 
business careers and education,"" says Jeanne M. Wilt, executive director of 
the new organization and assistant dean for admissions and career 
development at the University of Michigan Business School.

Over the next three years, the organization plans to substantially expand 
its membership of business schools and companies, serve alumnae of member 
schools and develop strategic partnerships with other key organizations 
that work with women and girls.  It aims to raise $20 million by 2004 to 
support its work.

Business members of the new group include Dell, Deloitte Consulting, 
Goldman, Sachs & Co., JP Morgan Chase & Co., Kraft Foods Inc., and Procter 
& Gamble Co.  Academic members are the business schools at Columbia 
University, Dartmouth (Tuck), the University of California Berkeley (Haas), 
the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, the University of 
Pennsylvania (Wharton), the University of Texas (McCombs), and the 
University of Virginia (Darden). In addition, the Committee of 200 (C200), 
a professional organization of businesswomen, the Consortium for Graduate 
Study in Management, and the University of Michigan Center for the 
Education of Women are members of the founding board.

Scheffy Wins Don Yoder Paper Prize
The American Folklore Society honored Zoe Scheffy, manager of Accounting 
and Personnel Services, with the 2001 Don Yoder Paper Prize at its annual 
meeting. The AFS Folk Belief and Religious Folklife Section chose Scheffy 
for her paper, ""S?mi Religion in Art and Museums.""

Scheffy's paper, which was presented at the Folklore, Religion, and 
Diversity Politics conference in Alta, Norway in June, 2000, has been 
accepted for publication in an upcoming book drawn from the conference 
proceedings. In the paper she shows how differing approaches to museum 
representation construct subjective and influential visions of S?mi culture 
and traditional spirituality. In particular, she focuses on the display of 
drums and their role in both S?mi identity and outsiders' perceptions of 
the S?mi people. The S?mi are the indigenous people of Scandinavia.

Scheffy received an MA in Folklore from Indiana University, and is 
currently working toward a Ph.D. in Folklore at Indiana, with minors in 
Central Eurasian Studies and Museum Studies. For more information, visit

Dan:

I have made only a few minor changes.  Additionally:
*	Should we briefly define nominal rationale in a footnote?
*	Could number 7 be condensed?  It seems a bit drawn out  at four
pages.
*	Under C.1. I believe the DASR Cut-Off Date refers to Connect DASRs
only.  Everything the UDCs have submitted to date states they will continue
to accept all other types of DASR requests including Disconnects and
Updates, therefore I deleted the first example on our second objection.
This also appears to bring our third objection in to question as well.  
*	Should we mention that the UDCs did not clarify their definition of
DASR?  I am certain that they intended to say Connect DASRs, not all DASRs.
(I have confirmed this with SDG&E and PG&E and am waiting on a response from
SCE.)
*	You mention you are waiting for something from Jeff Dasovich on the
final item.  Have you received anything?  All I have seen is an outline type
document sent around on the 21st, is there something additional?  I have
some questions concerning how we would send a DASR to the PUC.  Perhaps I
have missed something.  If you, or someone in AReM, could explain I would
appreciate it.

Vol. 3, No. 22

Governing a Northeast RTO

When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruled that the three N=
ortheastern ISOs ? the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Independent System =
Operator (PJM), the New England ISO (NEISO), and the New York ISO (NYISO) ?=
 should become a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), some hoped that =
these birds of a feather would flock together. After all, PJM, NEISO, and N=
YISO are examples for the country, teaching that RTOs are an essential cond=
ition for the creation of competitive wholesale markets. The three ISOs als=
o individually oversee very small markets that are vulnerable to market pow=
er, have higher than necessary transaction costs, and other problems precis=
ely because of the scope of their individual markets. Indeed, even once all=
 three markets are merged, the combined market will account for less than 1=
5 percent of the nation?s generation. All these factors would drive rationa=
l participants focused on creating genuinely competitive markets toward mer=
ger. At least one would think so.

Yet so far, an intensive mediation process reveals that nobody is checking =
parochial interests at the negotiating-room door. In terms of the new RTO b=
oard and membership, participants are haggling about whether 3+3+3=3D1 inde=
pendent board or whether 5+3+2 does. Such equations will never balance, no =
matter how hard one tries. The greater good is getting lost in turf battles=
 and worse. If this myopic behavior continues, the result will be that all =
regions and all states lose, because they cannot see beyond their own noses=
.=20

Consequently, the ball is squarely back in FERC?s court to direct the devel=
opment of a successful RTO. It now faces some key decisions as it attempts =
to make good on the promise of the merger: to improve market efficiency, di=
minish market power concerns, improve interconnection rules for renewable e=
nergy resources, and reduce costs to consumers. For demand response and ren=
ewable energy advocates the stakes are especially high. Indeed the expansio=
n of PJM into the Allegheny Energy control area was crucial to resolving in=
terconnection issues that allowed development of the Mill Run, Pennsylvania=
 15-MW wind farm and enables future wind development in West Virginia that =
will in January 2002 be significantly within PJM.

The ability of the Northeast RTO to make effective decisions and follow thr=
ough on those decisions will determine its eventual success or failure. But=
 the debate over RTO governance begins and ends with the fact that FERC dir=
ected that PJM be the platform for the new organization, utilizing the ?bes=
t practices? from NYISO and NEISO. PJM has the greatest experience and most=
 successful track record of the three ISOs and is about the same size as NY=
ISO and NEISO combined. At the same time, NYISO and NEISO have performed we=
ll and have addressed some issues more successfully than PJM. The recent PJ=
M report to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission confirming that PJM?=
s thoroughly discredited ICAP market was indeed manipulated by a ?single ma=
rket participant? which exercised undue market power in early 2001 is a tim=
ely reminder that PJM does not walk on water.=20

Unfortunately, rather than tackling implementation issues solely on their m=
erits, debates have retained the persistent undercurrent of ISO, regional, =
stakeholder and corporate turf wars or self-interests.=20

Only FERC can get the process moving swiftly in the right direction by dire=
cting that the new RTO be an independent entity with superior board experie=
nce and clear decision-making authority responsive to genuine stakeholder i=
nput. There is no place for perpetuation of existing ISO self-interests, se=
lf-serving stakeholder vetoes, or regional power brokering.=20

Four principles are critical in the formation of any governance structure: =
board experience and independence, effective input of all stakeholders, suf=
ficient board decision-making authority, and sufficient monitoring of marke=
t power.

An Independent and Experienced Board=20

Happily, the three proposals which emerged from the mediation process requi=
re members of the board to be independent from any of the market participan=
ts, precluding working for any of the companies doing business in the North=
east RTO markets, owning stock in member companies, or participating on any=
 affiliated boards.=20

In contrast to this good news is the bad news that the three proposals focu=
s too heavily on giving each existing ISO proper representation on the new =
RTO board, and what the proper representation would be. This regional focus=
 undercuts independence and treats the RTO board like the United States Sen=
ate where each Senator comes from a state and argues for its interests. Loy=
alty to the home ISO becomes the real requirement in such cases, not indepe=
ndence.

Independence for the new RTO board membership should also mean independence=
 from the institutional interests of the existing PJM, NYISO, and NEISO. Ev=
en if the existing ISOs retain operation for an extended period, it would b=
e for practical, technical reasons, not because the ISOs themselves are a n=
ecessary constituency. To take a seat on the Northeast RTO board, all new R=
TO board members should resign any existing ISO board positions. The only f=
iduciary responsibility these board officers should have is to the new orga=
nization.

The new RTO board should include the most qualified individuals, without un=
due emphasis on whether or not they previously served on a particular ISO b=
oard. It makes sense that some, but perhaps not all, of the individuals on =
the new RTO board will have previously served on ISO boards. Such experienc=
e is invaluable. Yet it appears that some parties are stuck in the rut that=
 ISO experience must bring ISO baggage. If the fiduciary duty of RTO board =
members is clearly to the RTO instead of to a prior ISO, it will be easier =
to get beyond ISO power issues. To encourage the movement of the most quali=
fied ISO board members to the new RTO board, the ?transition? board also sh=
ould be or become the initial ?permanent? Northeast RTO board.=20

Rather than on representation, selection of RTO board members should focus =
primarily on the breadth of issues that will be facing the new RTO. A well-=
rounded set of board experience and skills is essential to addressing such =
important issues as demand response, interconnection of generators, cost re=
covery mechanisms, system planning, and reliability.=20

The new RTO board should have members with regulatory, financial, environme=
ntal, consumer and reliability backgrounds. Besides providing voices genuin=
ely without the baggage of prior ISO affiliation, the initial RTO board sho=
uld probably, for example, include someone with substantial experience in m=
erging organizations. The search process for new board members should be do=
ne in an open manner with input from all stakeholders to ensure adequate ex=
pertise in the diversity of issues that will face the new RTO.=20

Stakeholder Input

Meaningful stakeholder input is crucial because the RTO will be fundamental=
ly charged with serving the public interest in an industry that is at the h=
eart of our economy, security, and environment. Moreover, no board or manag=
ement team can adequately predict all of the impacts brought on by rule cha=
nges without close coordination with market participants. The RTO will ulti=
mately survive only if it maintains its credibility and the confidence of t=
he public.=20

The three existing ISOs have made a substantial transition from a narrow co=
nception of stakeholders as ?transmission owners? to encompass ?market part=
icipants? and even to include public representatives. PJM has recently expa=
nded the types of parties that can participate in the process by facilitati=
ng the ability of State Consumer Advocates to join and be voting members. O=
ther ISOs have gone even further by specifying specific categories for envi=
ronmental agencies and individual consumers (and minimizing the costs of jo=
ining.) Of course, many stakeholder processes require so much time and expe=
nse that it is difficult or even impossible for such stakeholders to meanin=
gfully participate.=20

But while opportunities for genuine and appropriate stakeholder input are e=
ssential, stakeholder processes cannot become an excuse or a means to avoid=
 problem solving. There is a fine line between genuine stakeholder input an=
d de facto special interest veto power. Over the past four years, PJM relie=
d heavily on its membership to make improvements to market rules and has th=
e best (though still flawed) wholesale energy market in the country. Yet it=
 is equally clear that stakeholder input can impede positive changes, such =
as eliminating the ICAP requirements or implementing demand-response propos=
als.=20

These concerns are balanced by having stakeholder opportunities for input b=
uilt into RTO problem solving, without allowing stakeholder processes to ha=
ve a life of their own or the pretense of being the board. Stakeholders sho=
uld not only be able to comment on proposed changes but also should constan=
tly look for ways to improve the market and be able to communicate these su=
ggestions to the RTO board. In turn, the board should take these suggestion=
s seriously. This healthy relationship is hard to reduce to rules and rules=
 alone cannot create it. Ultimately only a combination of rules, incentives=
, and personal leadership can make it happen.=20

Decision-Making Authority

Ultimately, the RTO board should be able to file changes with FERC on all m=
arket rule changes and reliability changes, with stakeholder input but with=
out specific stakeholder approval. The RTO board must have the ability to f=
ile under the more broadly defined Section 205 of the FPA.=20

One example of the effective use of this type of intervention came earlier =
this spring. After months of negotiation on an economic demand-response pro=
gram, several PJM market participants chose to block passage. The PJM board=
 reviewed the results of the various votes on the demand-response programs,=
 determined that the programs were justified and important, and filed the p=
roposed rule changes, which FERC approved.=20

Since individual ISO boards will likely remain during a transition phase, a=
ll FERC filings should be made through the RTO board, which would have fina=
l decision-making authority.=20

Market Monitoring

Effective, independent market monitoring is essential to identifying market=
 power problems and fixing them. But an effective market monitoring presenc=
e also requires close observation from inside the RTO. PJM?s Market Monitor=
ing Unit (MMU) works for and reports to PJM.=20

As more parties attempt to merge and contractually control more assets, mon=
itoring market power will become more important. The market would be better=
 served if the MMU were more independent of PJM, perhaps reporting directly=
 to FERC and the board. The MMU must have both the ability to identify mark=
et flaws and the authority to make corrections in a timely manner, without =
being subjected to a committee process that could delay or avoid effective =
responses.=20

Next Steps

Since the mediation process, FERC has been working to incorporate state reg=
ulatory agencies into the development of the RTO. But as with other stakeho=
lders, too many states are allowing parochial interests to interfere.=20

To keep the process moving, an independent search firm should review existi=
ng board members and potential new candidates to determine what would make =
for an effective RTO board which meets the criteria outlined above. FERC sh=
ould then direct the new RTO Board to start the long process of creating a =
fully functional and effective RTO. The first task of the RTO board is to c=
ommission an implementation team and set out the overall direction.=20

Second, FERC should establish an inclusive stakeholder process that can eff=
ectively communicate to the board.=20

Finally, FERC should empower a Market Monitoring Unit that reports directly=
 to the Commission as well as the board.

With these steps, the birds of a feather that PJM, NYISO, and NEISO really =
are could finally flock together.

Internet Daily 
for Monday, November 26, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Etail winners have solid foundation

Yahoo  and Microsoft  reported Monday dramatic year-on-year 
increases in online shopping over the holiday weekend.

Yahoo's Jennifer Dulsky, senior brand manager, said the number 
of transactions through her site was 75% greater compared to the 
weekend after Thanksgiving last year, while Jim Barr, 
Microsoft's general manager of commerce services, said online 
visits to MSN Shopping were 150% higher. Both executives said 
that while the overall number of selling merchants was 
comparable to last year, there are fewer ""pure play"" etailers 
and more in the way of traditional retailers, including 
Nordstrom  and Neiman Marcus.

In a similar vein, visits on Friday to Web sites set up by some 
other major brick-and-mortar retailers more than doubled from 
last year. ""Five of the six top virtual department stores find 
their roots in strong brick-and-mortar brands,"" said Sean 
Kaldor, vice president of analytical services at 
Nielsen/NetRatings. Such a presence ""has proven to be a 
successful online formula.""

Amazon.com  was the sole Web-only company to be among the 
biggest draws. It had 1.7 million visitors this year, compared 
to 1.3 million last year. Still, this performance was more than 
five times the number drawn by even the biggest gainer among 
traditional retailers' sites, Wal-Mart, whose visitors totaled 
355,000, up 132% from a year ago. Other online winners from the 
""real"" world included Target, Kmart, Sears Roebuck  and J.C. 
Penney.

Kaldor said 22% more home Internet users went online holiday 
shopping Friday, compared to the average for Monday through 
Thursday. But Friday's uptick was not as pronounced as the 27% 
increase seen last year, Kaldor said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
AOL membership passes 32 million

AOL Time Warner  said Monday its global online service has more 
than 32 million subscribers. That's a gain of 7 million members 
in the past year. Barry Schuler, America Online's chairman, 
credited the company's new AOL 7.0 software for helping the 
average at-home user's online usage to rise to nearly 70 minutes 
a day. The access program has been downloaded more than 7 
million times since it was released last month. AOL also said 
its premium-priced service for high-speed broadband connectivity 
has met with ""strong"" consumer demand in 18 of Time Warner 
Cable's largest markets.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
eBay searches offline for customers

EBay  will use an eight-page printed catalog insert in 55 
newspapers across the nation this holiday season to draw traffic 
to its online auction sales. The company plans to distribute 23 
million copies, according to The Wall Street Journal. ""What we 
know about the holidays is people traditionally shop in catalog 
format,"" Annette Goodwine, eBay's senior director of brand 
marketing, told the Journal. EBay is expected to spend $40 
million for advertising this quarter, including the catalog and 
television commercials broadcast on AOL Time Warner cable 
properties.

Not sure if you guys heard about these anti-abortion trucks, but I had not.
I saw two of these trucks this morning and they are so disgusting that I
believe it is borderline harassment or obscenity.  It?s difficult because I
believe so strongly in free speech, but this really was upsetting.  You can
check out their web site at http://www.abortionno.org/
<http://www.abortionno.org/>   From there you can get into the pictures and
truck campaign.  It?s really unbelievable.

Another very bizarre week of football - especially tonight's game.  Kudos to
Brady for being the only one to predict a Tampa Bay Win (however, he went
against the 49er's!).

Cindy (yes, Cindy!) finally ousted Barrie from first place!

There are two newcomers to the top 10 list:  JAM and Eldon
They replaced Hank and Prentice.

Weekly prizes are:

1st place - Denis & Lynne - tied with Eldon - but the tiebreaker goes to
Denis and Lynne
2nd place - Eldon
3rd place - Andy (who moves into 3rd place overall as well)
4th place - Cindy - and we all know what place she's in!

Only 6 more weeks to go - good luck to all!

THIS WEEK'S GAMES START ON THURSDAY - PLEASE GET YOUR PICKS IN BY 5 PM ON
THURSDAY

<table border=""0"" width=""90%"" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><font face=""verdana, arial, geneva, helvetica"" size=""2"">The biggest news of the day was Skyline Ventures, which makes early-stage healthcare and life sciences investments, announcing that it landed $150 million in committed capital for its new fund, Skyline III, and its affiliated fund, Skyline Expansion Fund. Skyline plans to invest as much as $10 million to $12 million per portfolio company over the course of several venture rounds through Skyline III, with typical initial investments ranging from $4 million to $5 million. Skyline III will focus on early-stage investments in drug discovery tools, biotechnology, medical devices, and healthcare information technology. The Skyline Expansion fund will focus on mezzanine-stage investments.<br><br>Monday was a quiet day for fundraising went with nine companies raising
$60 million, but IronPort Systems, an Internet messaging technology firm, is expected to announce its launch today with backing from investors including Hotmail founders, Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith. The company has also entered into a partnership with Dell Computer. IronPort, which raised a $3.9-million seed round in February, was founded a year ago by CEO Scott Weiss, a former executive with Microsoft and Hotmail, and chief product officer Scott Banister, founder of Listbot, an e-mail list hosting service acquired by Microsoft.<br><br>Meanwhile, there were more shakeups at Mahi Netowrks. The optical transport switch router developer that laid off a third of its 300-member staff in September said CEO Greg Peters has left the company and the company has appointed
Chris Rust, partner with Sequoia Capital, as an interim CEO as it searches for a permanent replacement. Elsewhere SANgate lost its CEO after EMC won a ruling on Doron Kempel&#39;s non-compete agreement.

STOCKS POISED FOR REPRIEVE

U.S. stocks were set to take a breather from the recent rally at 
the open, continuing the trend from overseas as Nokia Corp. 
(NOK,25,f2) cut its forecast for global wireless demand for 2001 
and projected a less optimistic forecast for 2002 demand than 
that of previous estimates by other major industry players. 
Earnings news was fairly sparse with Tech Data (TECD,40,f1) and 
K-Mart (KM,6.85) both beating the Street's estimates. Treasuries 
were softer ahead of today's consumer confidence data, scheduled 
for a 10:00 a.m. EST release.

Merchandise discounter K-Mart Corp. reported a 3Q loss excluding 
charges of $0.25 per share, slightly better than the First Call 
consensus estimate for a $0.27 per share loss as the company 
incurred costs from re-tooling its supply-chain infrastructure. 
Same store sales fell 1.5%.

Global IT hardware and software provider Tech Data Corp. was 
trading higher in premarket activity after posting 3Q profits 
excluding charges of $0.58 per share, ahead of the Street's 
$0.51 per share consensus estimate, as sales declined 19% to 
$4.2 billion. The company's CEO commented that, ""We continued to 
execute extremely well during the quarter, delivering solid 
results despite the weak economic conditions."" Additionally, 
Tech Data forecast 4Q earnings of $0.58-$0.63 per share versus 
the Street's $0.61 per share estimate.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were mixed, but generally lower as traders speculated that 
today's consumer confidence report may come in above analysts' 
expectations. Analysts per Bloomberg are expecting a November 
reading of 86.5 versus October's 85.5 level. Consumer confidence 
has been declining since June and is at its lowest level in over 
seven years.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets were lower after Nokia Corp. cut its 2001 sales 
estimate for global handsets to 380 million from the previous 
390 million forecast and said it anticipates worldwide sales of 
420-440 million phones in 2002, slightly lower than Motorola's 
(MOT,17.96,f2) earlier 420-460 million forecast. The wireless 
giant expects sales to increase by 15% in 2002, with 25%-35% 
growth in 4Q of 2002. Earlier in the day, Bank of England 
Governor Sir Edward George commented that the global economy 
will potentially recover more quickly than expected next year 
and that chances of a recession in the UK are slim due to the 
strength in consumer spending. George said he couldn't 
understand the relative weakness in the euro. Nevertheless, the 
euro-zone currency continued lower against the dollar ahead of 
today's consumer confidence data in the U.S. The Bloomberg 
European 500 index was down 0.5% as of 8:54 a.m. EST, led by 
weakness in tobacco and insurance stocks while manufacturing and 
telecom issues were higher.

The Nikkei 225 index led Asian markets lower, closing down 1.0% 
on weakness in communications and banking stocks after Fitch 
downgraded the credit ratings of several large Japanese banks, 
saying that the government is not in a strong enough position to 
support the beleaguered industry. Shares of NTT DoCoMo 
(NTDMY,71) fell after the wireless operator found a flaw in its 
high-speed wireless Internet services phones made by NEC Corp. 
(NIPNY,10.28) and Standard & Poor's said it may downgrade the 
company's credit rating on restructuring concerns. The yen was 
trading flat against the dollar. Crude oil got a boost after 
President Bush demanded that UN weapons inspectors be allowed 
back into Iraq, threatening oil supplies from the region.

well Eldon and Cameron tied but neither put a tiebreaker down so they split
first and second place and each get $40.  Scott won 3rd for $10 - which he
needs to collect from Prentice (good luck!)

Nope.  Loretta is straddling the fence.  Duque and Bilas are opposed. Brown
hasn't a real clue.  Davis isn't sure.  Sempra doesn't care because the MOU
is more important.  SoCalGas can't lobby.  Might just get voted out....

Subject: Proposal AREM response to UDC Joint Filing - Implementation of
Su spension DA


I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.  
 <<arm-puc-plan.doc>> 
Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for review
and validation

FYI...

Here are the confirmations regarding what type of DASR the Joint UDC
Proposal addresses from each of the three UDCs.

PG&E
Rebecca:

In response to your questions regarding our latest Joint Proposal, here is
my answer to your specific questions below:

a) The DASR Cut-off etc mentioned in your recent filing indeed refers to
Connect DASRs only
As the primary purpose of the implementation of the suspension of DA is to
identify accounts that are eligible to go DA, the ""DASR Cut-off"" reference
is for CONNECT DASRs only.

b) All other DASRs, such as Disconnect and Updates, will continue to be
accepted regardless of any implementation of a Cut-off or not.
Disconnect and Update DASRs will continue to be accepted for existing
accounts and new accounts to be switched as proposed in our filing.

Thanks,
Calvin Yee
PG&E

SDG&E:
a) The DASR Cut-off etc mentioned in your recent filing indeed refers to 
Connect DASRs only, 

This is correct, the joint proposal refers to new connects 

b) All other DASRs, such as Disconnect and Updates, will continue to be 
accepted regardless of any implementation of a Cut-off or not. 

Updates DASRs and terminations DASRs will continue to be accepted. 

Lora Clay 
Strategic Lead - ESP Relations 
e-mail:  lclay@sdge.com

SCE:
I have seen the responses to Rebecca's questions from SDG&E (Lora Clay's
comments are included in the e-mail below) and PG&E (by separate e-mail to
Rebecca from Calvin Yee, not included here).  SCE would agree that the
Joint UDC proposal regarding a DASR cut-off date pursuant to the joint UDC
filing on 11/16/01 refers to:

1)  ""Connect"" DASRs only, and that
2)   under such a DASR cut-off, SCE would continue to accept ""disconnect""
and ""update"" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering options) for
existing Direct Access customers (note: this is consistent with SCE's
previous communications regarding the subject of DASR cut-off date)

Jack Horne
Jack.Horne@sce.com

I have all three e-mails & will forward them to Dan today.

Web users surf twice as much at work

Web surfers in Italy, France, Australia and the U.S. who access 
the Internet from work spend considerably more time online than 
home Internet users. ""Work Internet usage adds up to more time 
spent online and more Internet sessions, undoubtedly due to 
greater connection speeds and better usability,"" explained 
Richard Goosey, chief of measurement science and analytics at 
Nielsen/NetRatings.  He said marketers should take the work 
audience into account. ""Applications such as banking, online 
trading and industry-specific directory searches are well 
targeted to the focused work audience,"" he said. In the U.S., 
NetRatings reported, male Web users spent an average of 21 hours 
44 minutes online at work each month and 11 hours 34 minutes at 
home.

Osama bin Laden, Harry Potter among top searches

Terra Lycos  reported that Osama bin Laden continued to be its 
most popular search term last week. Dragonball, Christmas, 
Thanksgiving and Harry Potter were also among the top 5 searches 
the site handled. The most popular cast member of Harry Potter 
isn't Harry himself,  Daniel Radcliff. According to Web users, 
the breakout star is actor Sean Biggerstaff, who portrays 
Harry's Quidditch rival, Oliver Wood.

Palm to end portal services

Palm Inc.  said it will close its free MyPalm Web portal Jan. 
10. Services such as an online calendar, address book and 
personal data will be deleted, the company said in a notice on 
its Web site. Services for wireless subscribers to Palm.Net will 
continue. A spokeswoman for the company told CNET interest in 
Web-based personal information management turned out to be less 
than expected. Advertising and subscriptions did not prove to be 
sources for adequate revenue.

Two-thirds of car buyers use Web

Sixty-two percent of all new-vehicle buyers are turning to the 
Internet for shopping information. Most go to the Web before 
they visit dealers, according to a J.D. Power and Associates 
study. Last year, Power reported 54% of vehicle shoppers relied 
on the Internet. On average, an automotive Internet user visits 
6.8 automotive sites before making a purchase, the research 
showed. Most also prefer independent Web sites. Kelley Blue Book 
 was the most visited site, as it has been for the past three 
years. Edmunds.com was said to be the most useful site.

All,

Unfortunately, Aaron and I will not be able to make this call.  However, we
wanted to let the group know that we are strongly opposed to New West's
proposal and urge the group to adopt the position we agreed to during last
week's call, i.e., oppose the UDCs' proposal for a DASR cut-off date, for
the reasons outlined in Dan's most recent draft.

Thanks.

Apologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought
to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion,
but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with
Bill and Aaron.  Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?

Best,
Jeff

Comrades:

Who wants to get together for a weekend in June at
some resort for one last hurrah before we all fade
into the sunset of each other's lives?  Chaminade, Sea
Ranch--something like that.

Let me know. If there's sufficient interest, we'll get
Cathy Langridge to be the Prep Committee.  (Just
kidding, Cathy.  Could someone please hand her a
tissue?) 

Just think:  another chance to get into serious
trouble as a group.

This is just a friendly reminder for the following event (and if you plan to attend, please respond to me directly):
Who are these so called account managers, Rich, Jenny and Mark? What do they do? How can we leverage off their expertise and they, ours? Do they have specific company contacts? Where can they be found? Will the ubiquitous pizza be served to entice you to attend? Strong possibility. Will I have to sign up on Bear Tracks? No. How can attending benefit me? It's up to you.

To answer these questions and many more, we will be scheduling during -

Thu, Dec. 6 during the break as well in the Career Center Conference Room (S420)

an informational session with the account managers.

Here's a description that Rich Wong, the financial services account manager prepared:

""The Haas Career Center staff includes 3 account managers that
can be a valuable resource to those that are exploring job or career
direction changes. Their role is to be the primary liaison for recruiters
in their specific industry sectors, being the one-stop shop point person
for companies interested in connecting with Haas MBA students.  They
cover a full spectrum of responsibilities from the logistics of setting up
presentations and interviews to establishing contacts and providing
strategic guidance to recruiters (including both hiring managers as well
as University Recruiting reps within human resource departments).
Through this activity, they gain insights into their company/industry
focus that they are happy to share with Haas students, John Morel,
and the other career advisors in the Haas Career Center.""

Feel free to contact them regarding questions on companies and industries
that they represent.  Conversely, please provide them with any valuable
contacts that you have in current/former employers that might help them aid your
schoolmates to find employment opportunities. They are located in the Recruitment Center
(S330 by the ATM machine) and their contact information is as follows:

Mark Friedfeld - Financial Services (Investment and Commercial Banking, Real
Estate, Venture Capital)

On Saturday morning, Annie took a decided turn for the worst.  The
Prednisone therapy had worked wonders for a few weeks (as the vet predicted)
- but her illness finally prevailed.  We made all her favorite things, but
we could not even get her to take a drop of water.  Last night Jeff came
over and sat with her and this morning Prentice and Eldon took her to the
vet and had her put to sleep.   They stayed with her the whole time and we
will take her ashes up to Mendocino where she had such fun.  She was a truly
great dog - and we will all miss her!  Thank you all for the love and caring
you gave her over the years.

Subject:  Graduation in Tahoe

The semester is coming to a close and most of us are graduating.  A group of
us are celebrating with a three-day weekend in a house on Lake Tahoe, Dec 14
- 16.  All are welcome to come, including families, significant others, and
other students whose e-mail address I don't have.

What do you need to do?
*	Find other students that are interest in going (I know Florian and
Anil are looking for housemates)
*	Find a house or lodging for the 2-3 nights
*	Let me know where you are staying and I will create a list and
distribute so we can all connect up there.

If you want to stay in the vicinity, our house is located at:

Petrick House
Lakeview

Dear Investor: 

My name is Ken Fisher. I write the ""Portfolio Strategy"" 
Column for Forbes magazine and serve as Chairman 
and Chief Investment Officer of Fisher Investments, Inc. 
My firm manages over $7.5 billion for institutions and 
high-net-worth individuals. 
   
I recognize you may not be considering doing anything 
differently with your investments right now. Regardless, 
I'd like to send you a kit of useful insights you can't get 
anywhere else free and without obligation.  

As soon as you fill out the online-request form, I'll 
email you the latest version of my Quarterly Report. 
It's designed to be interesting to investors whether they 
are interested in the full service we specialize in or 
not. The report, which I update with my latest 
thinking, highlights my viewpoint on: 
 
- Which stocks to select for investment now 

- The right balance between equities, fixed income 
securities and cash in this volatile market 

- The role mutual funds play in the portfolios 
of high-net-worth individuals 

- The impact of the Federal Reserve's actions 
on your investment strategy 
 
Fisher Investments' latest private Quarterly 
Report normally is given, along with their 
investment results, only to our clients. Each 
one has at least $500,000 in our care. 
After you have requested the Report, you will 
have the chance to review my Seminar on Money
Management. I strongly encourage you to visit 
the Seminar. It reveals the strengths and weaknesses 
of management options available to people like yourself. 

The reason I'm offering you this extensive intellectual
capital at my expense: I've found educating 
high-net-worth investors is good for our investment 
management business, whether any individual becomes 
a client or not. 

Some, for whom our outstanding client service and 
strong results are attractive, become clients. Others 
simply listen, learn and use our advice to inform their 
own management. But they tell their friends, some of 
whom prefer to have the details taken care of for them. 

Whichever group you fall into, please allow me to 
give you the benefit of my firm's original research 
and my thinking. I'm certain you'll find it interesting 
and useful. And, of course, FREE and without obligation. 

Thanks for your attention. I look forward to hearing 
from you. 

Sincerely, 

Kenneth L. Fisher 
Chairman and Chief Investment Officer

Jeff and Stan:

I lead the group responsible for assuring safe, reliable and timely
generation electric interconnections with PG&E's D and T systems. I work
closely with Rod Boschee's group that handles gas gen interconnections.

I just wanted to check in with Enron to see if the company was still
planning to go ahead with the Los Banos project and the Lodi project. It's
important we know Enron's plans to assure we conduct the most accurate
transmission planning studies possible given the number of projects in the
application process, notably at Los Banos. While we have sufficient funds to
continue the pending electric study at present, we are unsure of Enron's
desires. 

As for gas interconnection issues, given the discussions about the Lodi
project extension, it would be useful to know Enron's intent with that
project also.

Thanks,

Dear Investor:

The IPO market has come back with a bang!  A dozen 
very successful IPO's have come to market in the last 
few weeks and at least two dozen more are on the 2001
calendar. 

Magma Automation (LAVA: NASDAQ) closed its first day 
up $5.99, Weight Watchers (WTW: NYSE) rose over $7 in 
the first week and Fisher and Paykel (FPHC: NASDAQ) rose 
from its offering price of $18 to over $24 in the first 
week.  The month of December looks to be huge with billions 
in equity new issues scheduled to price.

How do you find out about these offerings BEFORE they 
come to the market?  TheStreet's IPO Pros PLUS is 
the answer.

For only $25 per month or $255, per year, TheStreet's IPO 
Pros PLUS is unique in bringing you professional insight 
into the IPO market.  Our staff of analysts, formerly traders 
in the IPO market and experienced professionals, analyze each 
deal that is coming to the markets.  In addition, we provide 
all of the important background information on the companies.  
If you invest in IPOs or you are thinking about doing so, this 
is a must have service that will pay for itself time and time 
again.

Jeff:
I've spoken with Keith and Dan and have put in calls to Evie and Bill.
We're all trying to figure out what to do and how to approach the CPUC.

In Enron's letter to President Lynch and the utilities, Enron's states
that ""we plan to submit within the next week DASRs to the utilities to
effect the return of a portion of our customer base to bundled utility
service and to transition some of our other customers to alternative
ESPs at the request of such customers"".  Since the letter was dated this
Monday, Dec. 3, that means Enron - as of Monday - was going to start
de-DASRs or switches to new ESPs by next Monday, Dec. 10, or even
earlier.

Is Enron still on this accelerated time schedule for switching to new
ESPs or de-DASRs?  I read this to mean Enron will literally exist the
direct access market for all its customers no later than Monday, Dec.
3.  Was something else intended? Has this schedule slowed down at all?

I think that if the CPUC believes Enron is really leaving by Monday, it
is just going to do nothing.  What should I tell the CPUC re Enron's
schedule?

Thanks,
Dian", <29054470.1075859212026.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,2001-12-06 12:27:39-08:00, dgrueneich@gralegal.com, jeff_dasovich@enron.com, CPUC,0

I wanted send you all a short note to congratulate you on the completion of 
the program!!!  Plus, I wanted to remind you that you have full access to 
the career center forever and my services for the next 6 months.  After 
that you can continue to use my services, although $ is involved.  The fee 
for alumni is $150 for three sessions.  If you are being challenged in the 
job market or need some perspective on getting hired, we can have an 
initial session for free and after that if we both decide to go further I 
will need to charge.

In the interest of adding value to the Haas brand, just an FYI this May I 
will be completing an 8 month program on Personal Performance Coaching from 
the Hudson Institute in Santa Barbara.  If you feel the need for fine 
tuning your new area of knowledge or competency and want some assistance 
finding or applying the fit in your career, let me know if I can help.

For those of you I have had the pleasure of working with thank you for the 
opportunity, it has truly been a great learning experience for me and 
hopefully for you as well.  Some parting thoughts:

IF WE DON''T

CREATE OUR OWN

FUTURE, SOMEONE

ELSE WILL FIT US

Comrades:

Each year, we students have the opportunity to
recognize from among the esteemed faculty members of
Haas those who have distinguished themselves from
their peers by their commitment to the least glamorous
of their tasks: teaching us stupid kids how to read,
write and do complicated long division sums. The Earl
F. Cheit Award for Outstanding Teaching goes to that
individual we deem worthy, from a pool of candidates
we nominate, based solely on our judgment as students
about our instructors (or maybe we just like their
looks--but let that not dissuade us from our sense of
duty).  The administration and faculty have no voice
in this award process, but must gaze upon us silently,
in awe and amazement at our power of discernment.  

Faculty who receive the Outstanding Teacher Award are
recognized for this important accomplishment by both
the UC Berkeley Campus and the Haas School of
Business. Last year's award went to Jonathan Leonard
(Core: Micro) with honorable mentions to Jonathan
Berke (Core: Finance) and Sarah Tasker (Elective:
Financial Information Analysis.) 


We are currently soliciting nominations for Fall 2001
courses. So, if you have gotten over your indignation
for having been put in the dunce corner once too
often, and finished copying ?I will not put motor oil
in Professor Lyon?s hot cocoa ever again? one hundred
times, you may reply to this email with your
nomination. Alternatively, if your server is as balky
as mine, submit a hard copy to the Evening MBA office.


We can only consider nominations with a written
explanation. There will be another round of
nominations for Spring 2002, but please remember that
only one nomination per student is accepted, so if you
nominate another faculty member in the Spring, it will
supercede this Fall's nomination.  In May, we will
select one individual from all nominations, based on
number of nominations received and the strength of
feeling exhibited by the nominors. 

Thanks, in advance, for your support of this important
and prestigious award. 

Joe Tambornino 
Chairman - Student Advisory Committee

Hey,
 
Fall semester is coming to an end and Spring is in the air.  Anyway,
before running off for the winter break, we'll need your transportation
requests.  What I'll do this year, out of the generosity of my heart, if
I don't hear from you I'll just assume you don't want to change, as
opposed to you don't want any assistance.  Is that good?
 
Anyway, if you really need to change your transportation commitment or
if you thought you asked for parking, but you didn't get any, SEND BACK
THE FORM.
 
Hope to hear from you soon.  Have a nice month off.

A record high for the year--2,613 points scored.

Ken scored 115, just four short of the all-time record of 119.

Cindy came in second and is in the money for the sixth time (not counting
Last Person Standing).

Andy, the Shea's and Mike&Lisa all tied for third.

Special congratulations to Cristina and Chris Shea--not only for the birth
of their first child, Isabella, but even though they are in eighth place for
the year, this is the first time they've been in the money.

The best move forward was made by Growney, who went from seventh to fourth
place.

WAM and the Commish moved out of the top ten and JAM and Hank moved back in.

However, only 27 points separate 13th from 3th place.

I do not know for sure which one) need to file their $1000 fee and their

To:      December 2001 Graduates
From: The Evening MBA Program Office 
 
We in the Evening MBA Program Office would like to take this opportunity
to officially congratulate you on your completion of the MBA Program.
We're proud to have you as alumni and know that you will go forward with
the same enthusiasm, drive and success that you have had in the Evening
MBA Program.
 
The following is a list of important upcoming events and general
information: 
 
Commencement 
The commencement ceremony will be held on Sunday, May 26 at 9:00A.M. in
the Greek Theatre (you may invite as many people as you'd like to the
ceremony).  We invite December 2001 and May 2002 graduates to
participate in this ceremony.
 
We plan to mail a commencement packet to your home address in March.
Included you'll find information on the ceremony, caps and gowns,
champagne reception tickets (minimal charge for more than 2 guests), and
a commencement speaker voting ballot.
 
Commencement information is available at the Haas Alumni Network at:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/alumni/newgrads/evmba.html
 
Diplomas
Your diploma will be ready in the Registrar's Office, 120 Sproul Hall,
about four to six months after you graduate.  It can be picked up
without charge.  The Registrar's Office will not give it to the Evening
MBA Program Office. You can have it mailed to you for a modest fee.  For

http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Records/transdipl.html

in May, a celebration for everyone!  All students, graduates and
families are welcome.  Invitations will be sent in April. 
 
Auditing Classes
After you graduate you may be interested in auditing classes.  A week
before classes begin, please contact the Evening and Weekend MBA office
to find out if there are seats available.  Then, with the approval of
the instructor, alums are able to audit classes for $500 per course plus
the cost of books and readers, available in the office. Since there is
no formal audit status at UC Berkeley, the class will not show up on
grade sheets.

graduate regarding Spring 2002 semester.  Please ignore them.
 
Evening News
We will continue to e-mail you copies of The Evening News for the next

activities, please let us know:

Greetings all,

My @home e-mail is defunct and I am not up on the new one yet. Fortunately, I 
kept my AOL account but I am back in the Dark Ages on a phone line with no 
DSL availability (slow, slow slow) and it ties up the phone.

Anyway,  Charry, could you send the list for Wil and Haley to me at 
dasovichd@aol.com.

Jeff asked me to send a list for my kids:

Katie:

1)  would like a trip downtown with Aunt Nancy and Haley at Christmas time to 
go window shopping
2) 1/2 hour massage 
3)music CD with Andean music

she's also asked for cool hair accessories and stationery but I think Mike's 
family is getting these

Michael:
1) fleece vest
2) anything about baseball or football (books,games)
3)sleeveless shirts (might be tough to find this time of year)
4) time with any of you on an outing

BIG SECRET: Santa is bringing both kids a Gameboy so a game would be good. 
Robert already got Katie a Harry Potter game. 

Target has Sponge Bob Square Pants and Rocket Power which I think Michael 
would like.

ALSO, everyone is invited to Christmas at our house, like last year, if you 
haven't been formally notified already.

Debbie

Dear Jeffrey:

. . . for startup managers these days is raising money,
and we can help. With ideas, and introductions. And you
can get both by spending just one day out of the office.
Today's funding environment is harsh -- we know that --
and investors are both more cautious and more demanding.
Yet there's money to be had and we've put together a one
-day conference of those who know how to get it.

Come learn  from the most active investors in later-stage
rounds. From CEOs who have  found new money in the last
few months.  From hard-to-reach experts like Tracy
Lefteroff, the Global Managing Partner of
PriceWaterhouseCoopers' Venture Capital Practice.  Or,
J. Sanford Miller, a co-founder of Thomas Weisel Partners,
most recently appointed Managing Director with 3i, (one of
the most active follow-on funders with 32 deals since June
1, alone).  Be sure to check out the site as more and more
speakers accept their invitations.

I hope your calendar allows you to join the other CEOs
and Investors on February 6.  To register your place and
hear these and other leading experts, please link to
http://events.venturewire.com/followon/ today and
complete the online registration form.  VentureWire's
last company-building summit in November filled quickly,
so please act promptly.  If you have any questions,
please contact me by voice on (212)343-1900 x165 or e-mail
at cunningham@venturewire.com

I look forward to hearing from you.

BOARD CAFE
The Newsletter Exclusively for Members of Nonprofit Boards of 
Directors
Short enough to read over a cup of caffe latte, the Board Cafe 
offers a menu of ideas, opinion, news, and resources to help 
board members give and get the most out of board service. Co-
published by CompassPoint Nonprofit Services and BoardSource 
(formerly National Center for Nonprofit Boards). Chef / Writer: 
Jan Masaoka. November/December 2001. Vol. 5 No.10.  Ready-to-
print version at: http://www.boardcafe.org.
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
Once I was on a board and was so unhappy with the new executive 
director that I decided to resign from the board.  I called the 
Board President to tell her I was leaving, and to my complete 
surprise, she said that nearly the whole board felt the same way.  
Since there had never been any disagreements or sharp words at 
any of the board meetings, I had assumed that everyone ELSE on 
the board was happy with the executive director.  The Board 
President had telephoned a few of the board members who had left 
before their terms were up, and she had been surprised to hear 
their dissatisfaction with the executive director.  That prompted 
her to call other board members who had the same sense.  A few 
months later, the executive director was fired, and she 
subsequently sued the organization for wrongful termination (the 
suit was settled at a low amount).  
This story links two of the topics for this month's Board Cafe:  
exit interviews for board members, and ""What Every Board Needs to 
Do About Insurance.""  Also an item on a terrific new book, and 
here's a link to Planet 501c3's ""Meeting-Shortening Maneuvers"":

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
EXIT INTERVIEWS FOR BOARD MEMBERS
What does it mean when board members leave?  Corporations 
routinely hold exit interviews with departing employees and 
tabulate the reasons for the departures.  If there seem to be 
silent and/or disgruntled board members leaving the board, a 
series of short telephone exit interviews might reveal important 
reasons why.  Ask a former board chair, consultant, or another 
neutral person to do the interviews.  In many cases, departing 
board members reveal that they have left due to disagreements 
with the executive director or the board chair, or are disturbed 
about the overall direction of the organization.  
PRACTICAL WAYS TO REACH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Does your organization want practical, real-life advice on 
reaching people with disabilities?  A GREAT book,  Access Aware: 
Extending Your Reach to People With Disabilities, is now 
available from the Alliance for Technology Access with points on 
language (Say ""She uses a wheelchair"" rather than ""She's confined 
to a wheelchair""), facilities (""Use the closed fist test for 
handles-to ensure that people with limited use of his or her 
hands can open the door"") and more.  One of the board's jobs is 
to ensure that the organization's services are accessible to 
everyone . . . this straightforward resource will be helpful both 
to the board and to staff. Go to 
http://www.ATAccess.org/resources/acaw/acawinterest.html or call 
800.455.7970.  $45 for a printed manual and $20 for the PDF 
version (both include online access).

Now for this month's ""Main Course"" at the Board Cafe:
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ABOUT INSURANCE
By Melanie Herman, Nonprofit Risk Management Center
Not every nonprofit needs every type of insurance.  But every 
nonprofit board should consider its insurance needs and the 
resources needed to protect the good health and mission of the 
organization. We offer 8 tips on insurance issues to get you 
started.
1. Examine exposures first. Rather than start with looking at the 
current insurance policies, begin by looking at how your 
nonprofit is exposed to possible lawsuits and losses. While 
lawsuits against nonprofits are relatively uncommon, the most 
common types of suits against nonprofit boards are ones that 
allege wrongful employment practices (such as wrongful 
termination), sexual harassment, or retaliation.  Which of your 
activities are more likely to lead to lawsuits, damage to 
reputation, finances or property? 
2.  Make sure your organization is working with an expert it can 
trust. An insurance agent, broker or consultant can provide 
valuable advice and practical help on coverage for your 
nonprofit. Seek someone experienced with nonprofits, and familiar 
with the work you do (or committed to learning about it). Your 
advisor should live up to the promises he or she makes, give 
prompt and credible answers to your questions, take the time to 
understand your organization and seem genuinely interested in 
helping you. To avoid awkward situations, and to prevent a 
potentially dangerous conflict of interest, choose someone 
unaffiliated with your nonprofit. 
3.  Have an annual report to the board on insurance and risk. If 
you don't have a board Insurance or Risk Management Committee, be 
sure that insurance review is assigned to another committee, such 
as the Finance Committee or to an individual board member.  
Though insurance policy language can be hard to swallow, and even 
harder to understand, it's important that someone from the staff 
or board read the policy from beginning to end, including the 
policy exclusions, endorsements and definitions. 
4.  Read the laws.  Ask the Risk Management or Finance Committee 
to look at the language in your state volunteer protection laws 
as well as the federal Volunteer Protection Acts.  Remember that 
none of these laws provides absolute protection against suits 
alleging wrongdoing on the part of nonprofit board members.  For 
more information about the federal Volunteer Protection Act, see 
http://www.eriskcenter.org/docs/protection.cfm.  State laws 
differ and some states do a better job than others of informing 
the public; find the link to your state's laws at 
http://www.eriskcenter.org/docs/s_state.shtml.  
5.  Reduce risk as well as buy insurance. Just as car insurance 
isn't a reason to drive recklessly, nonprofit insurance is only 
one element in risk management.  The board should consider 
conducting a risk management audit, or simply identifying ways to 
reduce risk.  There may be simple ways to increase building 
safety, to improve personnel policies, strengthen compliance with 
personnel policies, improve performance evaluations, or to screen 
staff and volunteers more thoroughly. 
6.  Talk over the various types of insurance and do what you can, 
when you can. No single insurance policy covers all exposures and 
some are more important than others, depending on an 
organization's circumstances. For some, a property policy 
covering buildings and personal property against accidental loss 
is most important. In another organization, a policy providing 
protection for volunteer injuries may be of first import. If you 
can't afford all of the coverages you'd like your nonprofit to 
have, start with the policy you consider most important and add 
others when you can. 
7.  Consider Directors & Officers (D&O) liability insurance. 
While many suits against nonprofits are brought against the 
nonprofit corporation as well as individual managers and board 
members, in a few cases suits are brought solely against board 
members themselves.  Many small nonprofits don't buy D&O 
insurance simply because they can't afford it.  In other cases, 
the board may decide that the risk of a lawsuit is too unlikely, 
or that there may be other ways to finance defending the board 
and the organization.  Whether or not you have D&O insurance, 
there are board practices that reduce the likelihood of a suit, 
such as preventing conflicts of interest, recording ""no"" votes in 
the minutes, and ensuring that the organization's employment 
policies are consistently applied.  For more about D&O insurance, 
see http://www.genie.org and click on ""Insurance"" in the FAQ 
section.
8.  Test the market. Every three to five years consider 
""shopping"" your insurance program. Invite several brokers or 
agents to submit proposals, or ask the broker to obtain bids from 
several insurance carriers. Doing so will give the board a basis 
for comparison and a sense about whether you're paying a fair 
price.  At the end of 2001, experts are predicting that insurance 
will become more difficult to buy, premiums will become more 
expensive and new exclusions and restrictions are likely to 
appear.  This might be a good time to consider changing to a 
different carrier or to review your overall insurance program.

Marc and Dan

Here is my latest version.  I have incorporated Dan's suggestions and have
added the introduction.  I want to keep the document as short as possible
so it will be read.

Dan

You will need to put this into the right format (heading, docket number,
etc.)  I am uncertain how/where to incorporate the plea for exemption or if
we should call it a motion to dismiss or what.  I will rely on your local
experience.  Clearly our goal is to get cut loose as quickly as possible.

Marc

You will note that I have called Enron a shareholder, but have not
identified how big a shareholder they are.  Is that too cute?  Should we go
on and 'fess up to the 43% share here?

Both

I am travelling Sunday and will be in Texas Monday - Wed.  My suggestion on
changes is this:  Marc, you can fax Dan at 818/346-6502.  You can call Dan
at 818/596-2201.  (Dan: Marc is my boss, so we try to do what he says.)  I
understand Dan needs this by noon on Monday because of travel and logistic
issues.  If you would both be so kind, please fax to me as well c/o Suzanne
Bertin @ 512/320-5920.  My cell phone is 914/646-3913.  I listen to
voicemail at the office regularly, tho, so feel free to leave a message
there.

Wow!  What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.
For every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being
selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the
continuing progress that the Canadians - yes, the Canadians - have made
towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep
after another throughout the year.   Let's see, in December 2000, who could
have predicted..

1.  The tragic events of September 11th.
2.  The California implosion.
3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment.
4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother
Nature did not help out).
5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring.
6.  Enron collapse.
7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO.
8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market.
9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.

2001 was one heck of a year - but thankfully, probably the nadir of the
movement towards energy competition in North America.  As CAEM looks into
our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see
a better year.  Below are some of the predictions and responses from the
CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.  The responses below are primarily
concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to
natural gas as well.

As always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.  We are just a
little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.  And we can.
And we do.

Happy New Year!

Hello Friends and Colleagues,

I am excited to tell you that starting January 7, 2002, I will have a
new job.  I will be the Vice President of Research Programs at the new
Electricity Innovation Institute in Palo Alto, CA.  EII is a spin-off
from the Electric Power Research Institute.  It's purpose is to lead
public/private research collaboration for clean, efficient energy and
the quality of life opportunities that electrcity-based innovation
provides.  Our first two projects will deal with reliability of the
electric system and integration of distributed generation into the
existing distribution grid.

I have really enjoyed my time with Green Mountain Energy Company and
firmly believe that customers will choose a cleaner, ""greener""
electricity product if given the opportunity.  However, this is a good
time for me to go in a new direction.

Starting January 7, you can reach me at 650.855.2100.  My e-mail address
will be rcouniha@e2i.org.

Until then, I am taking time off.  See you next year!

Rick

CAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002

What does Enron?s collapse mean?

1. Markets work.  Markets quickly punish mistakes.  Little slack is given for past accomplishments.  Markets are ruthlessly impersonal. 

2. No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.  Amazing that a company as large as Enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets.  Testimonial to benefits of markets. 

3. May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.  Not obvious who picks up the slack.  Enron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.  No more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.  Consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.  

4. Enron?s collapse was not caused by deregulation. Viewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.  Does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy. 

5. Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.  A strange legacy for Enron, but a reality. 

6. As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.  But not as bad as portrayed by media ? Enron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.  Will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring. 

7. Enron?s global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale? pro energy services?) Other corporations will now replace Enron in public policy debates; these corporations may have a clearer focus.  

8. Still, we have lost a champion.  CAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one. Enron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems. 

What will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in 2002?


1. CAEM believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue ? albeit much more slowly. 

2. Texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in 2002 and beyond.  Why?  The best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply.  The Texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market.  (Texas, through ERCOT, is unique in this respect.)  No price caps.  Market power of incumbents is limited.  Enlightened leadership at the Texas PUC from 1995 to 2000 (our friend, Pat Wood again ? but we believe Commissioner Perlman is a star as well) and in the Governor?s office. 

3. Other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies ? Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc. ? or avoid past mistakes altogether ? Virginia.  However, there will be very limited movement in these states. 

4. California will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the Governor on down.  There is a good chance that CAEM will again be awarding Governor Davis the ?Red China? award in 2002. 

5. Californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of ?involuntary? conservation. 

6. Very limited movement, perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects, in those states that have done nothing to date. 

7. Increasing effort to approximate market-like conditions, but under a regulated, cost-based system, with predictable results.  

8. Actually, beyond Texas, the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in North America is in Canada, particularly Alberta and Ontario.  Given the increasing interconnection between the U.S. and Canada, this will slowly work its way into the United States.  

9. It will be another wild ride for energy marketers in 2002.  More power to them. 

What will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in 2002?


1. CAEM believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity. 

2. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be successful, to a degree, in implementing Super RTOs (regional transmission organizations). 

3. CAEM supports the Bush Administration?s proposal to give eminent domain to FERC for the siting of new transmission lines.  However, this proposal faces tough sledding in Congress.  CAEM believes it will pass in some form ? probably very watered down ? out of necessity, but not out of love. Many in Congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity. 

4. The Federal government and the states will make progress ? probably embodied in a political deal ? on greater cooperation.  This will be regional in focus.  Both sides will give significant concessions to realize this.  

5. New players will enter market as it grows, including the oil companies and more foreign-based companies. 


Wildcards/ Predictions in 2002


1. The Bush Administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring.  To date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ? except making the right noises here and there ? of making energy markets more competitive.  This will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side. 

2. The new Electricity Advisory Board appointed by DOE Secretary Abraham will be seen for what it is ? a sop to campaign supporters.  Given its current make up, we expect very little to come of it.  Couldn?t they find more energy marketers, technology companies ? anyone that is a bit more pro-competition? 
3. The Department of Energy will continue to have little impact -- if any -- on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market. 

4. The Department of Energy will continue to fight for tougher appliance efficiency standards, while totally ignoring the far lower efficiency of electricity production, thus marginalizing its impact on energy efficiency. 

5. ?Comprehensive? energy legislation will probably pass in 2002.  The question is whether it will be truly comprehensive and have a separate and new section devoted to electric restructuring.  (The Senate version does and the House is working on one.)  Our guess is that it will to some degree.  Our hope is that the energy legislation moves beyond pork politics and members of Congress will resist the temptation to earmark projects.  Fat chance of that happening, but it is Christmas time. 

6. As part of the political deal, there is the opportunity for a ?New Federalism? policy to be realized for the energy sector.  If the Bush Administration truly wants to move competition forward, and yet have the states go along with it, a new block grant with conditions for moving towards competition could be formed to serve as a carrot.  The Feds do it with highway funds and education ? why not energy? The states, familiar with federal block grants for highways and education will try to cut as many of the ?strings? attached to the grants as possible. 

7. A major blackout in 2002.  The laws of probability suggest that we are due for a reminder about how old our infrastructure is and how the lack of attention to how these markets are performing will have consequences.  The U.S. has dodged many bullets in the past ? but probably not this year. (BPA will likely not cause the blackout this time, as it did twice in 1996, unless the Pacific Northwest gets a lot of snow this winter or a lot of rain this spring.) ( The blackout will likely not happen in Manhattan, since peak demand was reduced by ~ 300 mW on September 11th.)  We recognize this a risky prediction ? predicting what terrorists or what the weather may do always is ? but it is only a matter of time. 

8. The environmental movement will begin to wake up to the fact that its interests are not the same as those of consumer activists.  Competition will lead to more efficient production ? and thus less pollution ? to the extent it is allowed to occur.  Seeking lower prices at all costs, including the cost to the environment, consumer advocates want to preserve the monopoly model, which has led and will continue to lead to the maximum use of old, and polluting technologies and infrastructure. 

9. For that matter, the anti-coalition (kind of like anti-matter, not much there) of critics should splinter even further vs. organized labor (high costs, high prices). 

10. New grid-enhancing technologies, e.g., superconductivity, and distributed energy technologies, e.g., fuel cells, should make significant market gains in 2002, assuming Congress, DOE and EPA take no further actions to prevent this from happening.  There is a lot of pessimism in the distributed energy community right now ? and who wouldn?t be a bit pessimistic, given the exit of Honeywell from the market, the constant technical setbacks, the wariness of the utilities, the bickering and backbiting, etc.  But folks, this is the future ? and the future starts now. 

11. EPA will continue to protect the ?right? of existing generators to pollute at rates an order of magnitude greater than the pollution rates required of new generators, ?in the interest of fairness?. 

12. EPA will continue to discourage incremental improvements in the efficiency and emissions of existing power plants by insisting that the incremental improvements subject the plants to new source review. 

13. EPA will proceed with issuance of a proposed guidance document requiring combined heat and power systems and building cooling, heating and power systems to achieve better combined electrical and thermal efficiency than the best available separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion technologies, but will not require that all separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion installations use the best available technology. (No one will question why this efficiency requirement is coming from EPA and not DOE.) 

14. The tax code will continue to require owners of on-site generation systems to depreciate the systems over time periods longer than their expected useful lives.

Jeff --

Rule 22 provides with respect to the situation in which the ESP and the UDC
are doing separate billing, that the UDC can require the ESP to establish
its creditworthiness in the same manner as required for ESP Consolidated
Billing, but only to the extent necessary to cover CPUC-approved charges
that the UDC bills the ESP directly.  In other words, if PG&E bills EES
directly for some service(s) that PG&E performs for EES, then PG&E can
require security (surety, cash, a guarantee) to the extent necessary to
cover that
charge(s).

Folks,

FERC is deliberating today on many agenda items.  Two they have approved
are:

1.  Modifying the June 19 Price Mitigation Order setting the price cap
at $108 until April  30, 2002, and decoupling the cap from California's
reserve deficiency, and instead tying the cap to the price of natural
gas (upwards, only).

2. Denial of Requests for Rehearing (in great part) on all California
Orders since last December 15 (2000), and ordering the California ISO to
submit a revised congestion management plan, and a plan for establishing
a day-ahead market, both plans due May 1, 2002.

Both Orders passed 3 Yea, and 1 No (MAssey, in part on the second
order).

>
>The Police Department offers services 24 hrs/day.  Some units within UCPD

>Police Dispatcher.  There may be slight delays in escort dispatch if more 
>urgent police business is in-progress.
>
>The following tips are provided to help everyone avoid being the victim of 
>thefts or other problems that occur more frequently during this period:
>
>1. Campus thieves are more active during the holidays. They typically come 
>into large buildings during the lunch period (11 PM to 2 PM) and prowl 
>through office areas looking for wallets or packages. Employees in card 
>access controlled buildings should be alert to strangers attempting to 
>""tailgate"" or follow an employee while they enter a building or floor. A 
>simple ""Can I help you"" or ""Who are you looking for"" may sort out the 
>potential thief from the legitimate visitor.
>
>2. Suspicious persons in buildings or office areas should be reported to 
>UCPD by dialing 9-1-1 from any telephone. NOTE: There is no longer a 
>requirement to dial an extra ""9"" prior to dialing 9-1-1 from campus telephones.
>
>If you are using a cellular telephone, we recommend that you do NOT dial 
>9-1-1 to report an emergency unless you are on a highway or out of your 
>home area because all cellular 9-1-1 calls are routed through the 
>California Highway Patrol and can experience significant delay. All 9-1-1 
>centers in California also maintain traditional 10-digit emergency 
>numbers.  To call UCPD from a cellular phone in an emergency, use our 
>10-digit emergency number 510-642-3333. We recommend that this number, as 
>well as local 10-digit emergency numbers for other areas that you 
>frequent, be programmed into convenient speed dial locations on your 
>cellular handset.  A list of 10-digit emergency numbers for many Bay Area 
>departments is contained on pages 71-72 of UCPD's 2001-2002 Safety Counts 
>booklet.
>
>3. People should avoid leaving their wallet or purse unattended in a 
>cubicle or office, particularly during the lunch period. Locking a wallet 
>in a desk or credenza will reduce the possibility of theft 
>significantly.  Similarly, packages should be secured in a locked room or 
>left where someone can watch them.
>
>4. People should make copies of their credit cards, checking account 
>statements, drivers license, and other critical documents they keep in 
>their wallet or purse along with the customer contact numbers to report 
>the loss of those cards and documents. The inventory should be stored in a 
>secure place both at work and at home. Major credit card companies such as 
>MasterCard and Visa offer a free service to consolidate the reporting of 
>lost or stolen credit cards which requires the employee to only make one 
>call. The loss of credit cards should also be reported to credit agencies 
>such as TRW to protect the employee from adverse credit reporting when the 
>card is misused.
>
>5. If purchases are made using credit cards, people should keep a copy of 
>the transaction as many companies offer free replacement of the purchased 
>item if it is lost or stolen within a certain period time.
>
>6. While shopping in malls, people should try to park in well lighted 
>areas as close to the mall as possible, as the majority of vehicle 
>burglaries occur in outer areas of the parking lot where there is less 
>foot traffic.  Packages should be stored in the vehicle trunk or covered 
>with a blanket or similar item if left in a station wagon, SUV, or other 
>vehicle with no trunk. People should use their auto alarm as noise does 
>tend to attract attention. Caution should also be used when parking in 
>BART lots and adjacent off street parking areas.
>
>7. People should use their home alarm system while they are away, 
>particularly during weekdays, as there is an increase in home burglaries 
>during this period. It is also helpful to place lights in a vacant home on 
>automatic timers to make a home appear to be ""lived in"" at night while you 
>are away.
>
>8. Finally, while everyone is enjoying all of the holiday festivities, 
>they should be mindful of the fact that traffic fatalities increase 
>dramatically during this period due to poor weather conditions and an 
>increase in alcohol consumption, particularly around New Years. Law 
>enforcement agencies increase their staffing during this time, and the use 
>of sobriety checkpoints is becoming widespread, particularly in the Bay 
>Area. Designated drivers at parties is a good tactic as is the use of a 
>taxi service which many cities provide for free on New Years Eve.
>
>Please pass this information on to the campus community along with our 
>wishes for a great and safe holiday season. If you would like to download

Jeff - per Beth Apollo's message.   The bottom line is what CSC really
needs to be able to invoice Calif power customers is the 810 EDI files from
all 3 CA utitlities.  They have stopped sending 810s to us and are only
providing 867's.   If we can't get the 810s going then the information
provided in the attached spreadsheets needs to get to us in order to
invoice.   This info could come via spreadsheet, or line item within the
867.   The business impact to Enron is that we have not been able to
invoice for these customers since Dec 5 and this is a large revenue amount.

Please call me - my cell phone is 713.305.1659 if you have questions.
After 11:30 central today, I will be on vacation and my backup Maggie Brown
can be reached 713.822.3753.

TO:  CMTA MEMBERS AND FRIENDS

FM:  JACK M. STEWART, PRESIDENT

RE:  HAPPY HOLIDAYS

In the spirit of this holiday season, California Manufacturers &
Technology Association is pleased to congratulate IBM as the recipient
of the 2001 Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award.  IBM was honored
both for its level of corporate giving and for the number of community
service hours performed by IBM employees.  IBM has been a CMTA member
since 1947.

In a larger sense, CMTA salutes all manufacturers for their
extraordinary level of giving this year and in years past.  From Andrew
Carnegie to Louis Gerstner, manufacturers have been the heart and soul
of American philanthropy.  Think of what California manufacturers have
given us:  David Packard's generosity created the world renown Monterey
Bay Aquarium; J. Paul Getty and his foundation brought one of the
world's greatest art collections to Los Angeles; ARCO, now BP, provided
the initial funding for the state of the art ARCO Olympic Training
Center in San Diego; and earlier this month, Intel co-founder, Gordon
Moore announced a $281 million gift to Conservation International, the
largest gift ever given to a private conservation group.

California manufacturers have a rich history of community involvement
and the staff at CMTA takes great pride in representing their interests
in Sacramento.  We thank you for your ongoing support and look forward
to working with each of you for a successful 2002.

Hello All, 

If you're like me and you've never been to one sporting event during
your time at Cal, here's your chance (if you have, come along for the
company).  For those interested, please join me on Jan. 19th. @ 5:00pm
when Cal will take on Washington State.  The tickets look like they are
$24.50 per person.  If you are interested, please let me know, so I can
try to get a block of seats together.  

Happy Holidays!! 

All the best,

The motion passed, and voting is closed.  We heard from all but one
board member (guess who?).

The vote was 8 YES, 3 NO.  The nay votes were from APS Energy Services,
New West Energy, and Constellation Power.  Reliant didn't vote.  The
rest were yea votes.

I will begin drafting the letter, with the guidance provided to me by
George Vaughn of Duke Energy.  I will not await until January 30.  More
likely, I will agendize the item for our January 8 Board meeting in
Walnut Creek.

Have a happy holiday.  I'm still working on the Burrito.  It's rather
long this week.

Current metering issues provided by Dionne Williams:

Meters installed without phone lines per Enron's direction (thus unable to
read) --  focus was on getting meters installed, will quantify by 1/1/02
(est. ~200 at this time)
Posting data on account numbers that maybe different than what the UDC
displays (causing MADENs) -- has been resolved
Inability to respond to MADENs in a timely manner -- MADEN is a
notification of a problem, will quantify by 1/1/02 (est. increase from 3 to
~100) , have increased staff to address workload increase.
Meter Installations taking priority over meter maintenance (per Enron's
direction initially.  This was changed first of November, thus Mario
dedicated one of his installers for maintenance. However, he is still
unable to respond to the maintenance calls in a timely manner)

Recap of Teressa Carroll-Childer's discussion with Jeff Dasovich at noon
yesterday:

Jeff was getting response back from the UDCs re metering issues
He was going to contact Dionne Williams directly to obtain feedback in
order to respond (Dionne has not heard from him)
Jeff was going to follow up with the UDCs yesterday

Hi Jeff, attached is the statement of services for Enron for November.  These have previously been sent to Sue Mara.  However, with her departure, it seemed best to send it to you.  As you probably know, our agreement was that the advice letter review service would terminate as of the end of December.  That's why I have been continuing to review the utility filings and send you summaries.  If the bankruptcy filing means something different for this arrangement, please let me know.
Thanks, and I hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday season and a healthy, happy and prosperous 2002!

Bargain hunters drive online sales

A sharp and unexpected rush to online shopping sites has 
occurred, according to Jupiter Media Metrix. The number of 
visitors to sites surveyed by the company last week, 52.3 
million, was 55% greater than the number last year, said Charles 
Buchwalter of Jupiter. By contrast, year-over-year growth rates 
declined each week last year as the holiday neared. That has not 
been the case this year. ""That translates into a holiday season 
where the majority of online shopping activity occurs closer to 
Christmas,"" he said. ""Many consumers waited until late in the 
holiday season to make their gift purchases, and many were 
searching for late-season discounts,"" said Jared Blank, another 
Jupiter Research analyst. He also said consumers have increased 
confidence about online sites' ability to deliver merchandise 
quickly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Web draws ""Spiderman"" fans

On the heels of this week's report that half of all online 
shopping occurs at work, office PCs are also turning out to be 
terrific movie preview theaters. Almost a million office workers 
were drawn to Apple Computer's movie preview Web site last week 
where they could see the trailer to ""Spiderman."" ""By releasing 
trailers on the Web, movie studios can reach a broader audience, 
said Jarvis Mak, a senior analyst at NielsenNetratings, Reuters 
reported.

Dear Abby gets wired

The U.S. military has adapted the annual Dear Abby season's 
greetings messages service for members of the U.S. military from 
snail mail to email. OperationDearAbby.net has changed from a 
postal service, hobbled several weeks ago by the anthrax scare, 
into an electronic bulletin board. More than a million messages 
have already been handled, according to Reuters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Orbitz under microscope, again

The Department of Transportation has been ordered to conduct 
another investigation of Orbitz, the online travel service 
backed by five major airlines. The probe is required by the 
transportation spending bill approved recently by Congress. The 
law's language suggests Congress is concerned that the airlines' 
service may reduce competition for ticket sales. A spokeswoman 
for Orbitz told ZDNet news that her company is angry. ""It's 
outrageous that our competition would call in a political favor 
with the goal of harassing a competitor,"" said Carol Jousaitis. 
Several federal investigations of Orbitz have been conducted 
previously, she said.

MSN Asia beefs up sales

consumer products manufacturers and financial institutions.

President Lynch has today released the attached ACR concerning market valuation of the utilities retained assets.  As you may know, AB 1890 originally required that for those generation-related assets that the Commission determines to be transition costs and that are subject to valuation, ""the valuation used for the calculation of the uneconomic portion of the net book value shall be determined not later than December 31, 2001, and shall be based on appraisal, sale, or other divestiture.""

Lynch states that this requirement was changed by AB 6X and that, ""I intend to recommend to my colleagues that the requirement to value generation-assets subject to valuation by December 31, 2001 has been superseded by AB 6X.  Parties shall file and serve comments addressing this issue by January 15, 2002.  Reply comments shall be filed and served by January 25, 2002.""

Morning Market View(TM) 
for Monday, December 24, 2001
as of 9:30AM EST
Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research


STOCKS FLAT IN PRE-HOLIDAY SESSION

Stocks are poised to open flat to slightly higher in the absence 
of any market-moving earnings news or economic data on this 
pre-holiday, abbreviated session. In equity news, Schering 
Plough (SGP,36,f2) won FDA approval in the U.S. for a 
potentially blockbuster drug. Treasuries are flat while European 
markets are generally higher, despite Argentina's debt default 
announcement. The U.S. equities market is scheduled for a 1:00 
p.m. EST close.

Shares of Schering-Plough were higher in premarket activity 
after the pharmaceutical giant received FDA approval late Friday 
for Clarinex, the successor to Schering's flagship allergy drug, 
Claritin, the patent on which expires in December 2002. Schering 
also said that it was close to resolving manufacturing plant 
problems previously cited by the FDA, which could include paying 
up to $500 million in fines. The company's CEO said he expects 
4Q earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.05 per share below the 
previous First Call consensus estimate, primarily due to the 
negative impact of its manufacturing difficulties on sales. He 
also said that full year 2002 earnings growth would be in the 
""low double-digits.""

Brewing giant Adolph Coors Co. (RKY,59,f2) has agreed to 
purchase Belgian Interbrew SA's (IBRWF,26) U.K. Carling unit for 
$1.7 billion in cash, providing Coors with one of Britain's 
leading beer brands. The move comes as Interbrew was ordered to 
sell Carling by British regulators as a result of its purchase 
of Bass Brewers and Whitbread Plc's brewing unit last year.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds were virtually unchanged across the curve in thin 
pre-holiday trading with no economic data slated for release 
until Wednesday's consumer confidence and existing home sales 
data. The Bond Market Association has recommended a 2:00 p.m. 
EST close for the U.S. government debt market today.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European bourses were mixed but generally higher, with the 
Bloomberg European 500 index up 0.4% as of 8:57 a.m. EST. 
Telecom service and banking stocks were higher, while travel and 
leisure stocks were lower following a thwarted attempt by a 
passenger to ignite an explosive aboard flight 63 from Paris to 
Miami on Saturday. The euro was trending lower against the 
dollar after Argentina's interim President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa 
suspended payment on up to $132 billion of government debt, 
saying instead that he would divert the payments toward creating 
jobs and assisting the poor. Though he maintained that the 
Argentinian peso would remain pegged to the U.S. dollar, he 
suggested printing new notes that provincial governments could 
utilize to meet obligations, a move that could potentially 
undermine the peg.

Asian markets were mixed with Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 
for a national holiday. The dollar hit a fresh 3-year high 
against the yen, approaching the 130 yen per dollar level, 
despite comments from Japan's trade minister hinting that it 
wouldn't be prudent to let the yen weaken any further. In other 
news, Japan's government approved a budget bill for its next 
fiscal year that will cut policy-related spending by 2.3%, a 
move that was advocated by the country's finance minister to 
expedite structural reforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:57 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was down 2 points while the Nasdaq 100 index was 3 
points lower (6 points above fair value). The March DJIA futures 
contract was down 10 points (2 points above fair value), while 
Nymex crude oil futures trading is closed in observance of the 
holiday.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

U.S. equity index futures are pointing to a slightly lower open 
in the post-Christmas session as economic and equity news is 
sparse. Wal-Mart (WMT,57,f2&f4) and Echostar Communications 
(DISH,27,f1) were among the few U.S. companies in the headlines 
this morning while U.S. Treasuries are lower and Japanese 
markets rose slightly.

Leading retailer Wal-Mart stated that it anticipates December 
same-store sales at the high end of the 4%-6% range, exceeding 
its previous forecasts. For the Nov. 23 to Dec. 24 period, the 
company said same-store sales were in the mid-to-upper single 
digit percentage range.

According to The Wall Street Journal, EchoStar Communications 
Chairman Charlie Ergen wants to expand Hughes Electronics 
Corp.'s (GMH,15.02,f2) satellite Internet service. If regulators 
approve Echostar's proposed acquisition of Hughes, the Journal 
reported, Ergen plans to postpone a ""full-scale deployment"" of 
the Internet service until 2004, opting to spend $1 billion in 
order to design and launch a ""new generation"" of satellites.

Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (PFE,40.77,f2) received a 
favorable court ruling related to its antidepressant drug 
Zoloft. A federal judge ruled the company is not liable in the 
case of a man who committed suicide while on the drug, despite 
allegations by the widow that Pfizer failed to disclose possible 
side effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

U.S. Treasury prices were a bit lower across the curve in the 
post-Christmas session. The Redbook retail sales index recorded 
a 4.5% drop for the three weeks ended Dec. 22, with 
year-over-year sales declining 0.6%. Tomorrow, the Labor 
department will release initial jobless claims and on Friday the 
markets will be watching for consumer confidence figures, as 
well as the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, home sales 
figures and durable goods orders.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets were closed for the holiday. In economic news, 
the French Producer Price Index fell 0.6% in November, twice the 
estimate, with the year-over-year figure falling a 
larger-than-expected 2.3%. On the corporate front, equity 
stories were expectedly sparse given the market closure. The 
euro is trading slightly lower versus the U.S. dollar.

Asian markets finished marginally higher as the Nikkei 225 index 
advanced 0.6%, with finance and construction issues leading the 
way. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (MHVYF,2.55) announced it 
plans to cut another 5,000 jobs, or 7.6% of its work force, and 
said it would not meet its goal of a 170 billion yen ($1.3 
billion) profit until 2006, two years behind schedule. The yen 
is higher versus the U.S. dollar, bucking a nine-day trend.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:53 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 Index was down 2.5 points (a point below fair value) 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was 3 points higher (5 points above 
fair value). The March DJIA futures contract was down 25 points 
(17 points below fair value), and the February crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were up $0.08 at $19.70/barrel.

SANTA CLAUS RALLY

U.S. equities are higher midday as some upbeat news in the 
retail and Internet sectors is giving equities a lift in the 
post-holiday session. Wal-Mart (WMT,59,f2&f4) reported it sees 
higher-than-expected December same-store sales while Internet 
portal Yahoo! (YHOO,18.03,f1) said sales at its shopping site 
increased significantly. U.S. Treasuries are trading lower and 
European markets are closed.

As of 11:46 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 
1.2% while the Nasdaq Composite Index is 1.9% higher. The S&P 
500 Index is up 1.2%. Oil-related and semiconductor shares are 
pacing the advancers while steel and toy issues are leading the 
decliners.

Leading retailer Wal-Mart is higher after the company stated 
that it anticipates December same-store sales growth at the high 
end of the 4%-6% range, exceeding its previous forecast. For the 
Nov. 23 to Dec. 24 period, Wal-Mart said same-store sales growth 
was in the mid- to upper- single digit percentage range.

Shares of Internet portal Yahoo! Inc. are higher on news that it 
saw an 86% increase in sales at its shopping site during the 
holiday season with ACNielsen figures indicating Yahoo customers 
spent $10.3 billion in 4Q.

Micron Technology (MU,31,f2) is higher amid continued 
speculation that the company is close to agreeing to an alliance 
with South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor (HXSCY,$9.90). A month 
ago, the two firms reported they were in ""exploratory"" 
discussions regarding strategic options, however, no official 
announcement has been made at this point.

Shares of EchoStar Communications (DISH,27,f1) are slightly 
higher after The Wall Street Journal reported that it wants to 
expand Hughes Electronics Corp.'s (GMH,15.02,f2) satellite 
Internet service. If regulators approve Echostar's proposed 
acquisition of Hughes, the company's chairman said he plans to 
spend $1 billion on Hughes' Spaceway unit and increase ownership 
in fixed satellite firm PanAmsat (SPOT,22,f1).

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasury prices are lower across the curve midday ahead of 
tomorrow's planned $23 billion 2-year Treasury sale. In today's 
only economic release, the Redbook retail sales index recorded a 
4.5% decline for the three weeks ended Dec. 22nd, slightly ahead 
of Bloomberg's -4.6% estimate, with year-over-year sales 
declining 0.6%. Tomorrow, the Labor department will release 
initial jobless claims and on Friday the markets will be 
watching for consumer confidence figures, the Chicago Purchasing 
Managers' Index, new and existing home sales, and durable goods 
orders.

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are closed for the Christmas holiday. In 
economic news, the French producer price index fell 0.6% in 
November, twice the estimate, with the year-over-year figure 
falling a larger than expected 2.3%. The euro is flat versus the 
U.S. dollar. Crude oil got a boost following statements from 
Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi that OPEC will officially 
announce a 1.5 million barrel per day supply cut on Friday.

Internet Daily 
for Wednesday, December 26, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Sites tout strong online holiday sales

Yahoo says visitors spent $10.3 billion online in the fourth 
quarter, beating analysts' expectations of 10% growth by more 
than eight times. Sales volume during the period running from 
Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve was up 86% compared to the same 
period last year, said Rob Solomon, vice president and general 
manager of Yahoo Shopping. He said bargain hunting was a major 
driver this season -- and one to which his site is catering 
after Christmas. Yahoo launched a post-holiday sales center 
Wednesday morning, through which it will offer discounts of 50% 
to 75% on items from Banana Republic, Old Navy and SonyStyle. 
Yahoo will also open an Unwanted Gifts showcase on its auction 
site. ""Consumers can auction off their undesirable gifts and 
shop for products they really want,"" Solomon said.

Separately, comparison shopping site BizRate.com's estimate of 
online shopping was similar to Yahoo's. During the weekend 
before Christmas, online shopping transactions were valued at 
$345 million, a gain of 73% compared to last year, BizRate.com 
said. Another interesting factoid: 52% of the shoppers were men.

Meanwhile, Terra Lycos said results of its online shopping 
season confirmed early predictions that bargain hunting would be 
in the forefront of consumers' minds were right on target. ""The 
tone and attitude of this season was different,"" said Kim Kluck, 
group product manager for Lycos Shopping. Moreover, she said 
there was plenty of evidence of cocooning. ""The values of giving 
and gathering, or keeping family close together and safe at the 
holidays, emerged early,"" she said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Media Metrix makes accuracy revisions

Web audience-measurement company Jupiter Media Metrix has 
decided to separately report Web site visits generated by 
pop-up, pop-under and other ""involuntary"" means. Previously, the 
company's listings of Web properties included sites that use 
such advertising techniques. The decision to include such 
traffic in a new ""promotional servers"" category reflects 
adaptation to ""the evolving Internet landscape and industry's 
needs,"" Media Metrix said. Sites in this category will not 
appear in any of the company's other measured categories, but it 
will include sites that sell email lists, opt-in email 
providers, image servers and promotional links.

Media Metrix also said it would include elements of major portal 
sites in its popularity ranking of Web sites by category of 
content. This means traffic to the personal-finance, real-estate 
and travel portions of AOL Time Warner's America Online, 
Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, Yahoo  and others will be reported as if 
they were stand-alone properties in those categories. The reason 
to do this, said Will Hodgman, president of the company's 
measurement business, is demonstrated by the finding that AOL 
properties ranked among the top 10 in 37 categories, while 
Microsoft and MSN-branded components were in the top 10 in 30 
categories, and Yahoo's placed in 10 of the top 30 as well. 
""This will provide the most accurate snapshot and reliable 
performance metrics to meet the needs of all companies with a 
stake online,"" he said.

MARKETS LOOK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY HIGHER

U.S. equity index futures are pointing to a slightly higher open 
as economic and equity news is sparse this morning. Apple 
Computer (AAPL,22,f1) said its retail outlets may report a loss 
in 2002 and TMP Worldwide (TMPW,42,f1) stated it would not boost 
its offer for Hotjobs.com (HOTJ,10.67,f1). U.S. Treasuries are 
flat and world markets are higher.

TMP Worldwide, provider of the popular Monster.com web site, 
reported that it would not increase its bid for competitor 
Hotjobs.com, saying it had offered ""full and fair value"" for the 
entity. Hotjobs announced on Monday that it would accept a $436 
million offer from rival bidder Yahoo! (YHOO,17.51,f1) if TMP 
did not increase its proposal, which has shrunk since June given 
declines in TMP's stock. If the acquisition fails, TMP is 
entitled to as much as $17 million in termination and 
reimbursement fees from Hotjobs and the company would remain the 
No. 1 online recruitment site.

Apple Computer said it now expects its retail stores to incur a 
loss in 2002, contrary to forecasts made last May predicting 
retail profitability for the year ending in fiscal 2002. Apple 
blamed the setback on the economic recession in the U.S. and the 
slowdown in the PC market, exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. 
The California-based computer maker opened 27 retail stores this 
year, two more than originally planned.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

U.S. Treasury prices are little changed across the curve ahead 
of today's record $23 billion 2-year note auction. Friday's 
economic plate is full as initial jobless claims, originally 
scheduled for release this morning, will be released tomorrow. 
In addition, consumer confidence figures, the Chicago Purchasing 
Managers' Index, new and existing home sales, and durable goods 
orders will be reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets are marginally higher with the Bloomberg 
European 500 index up 0.8% as of 8:53 a.m. EST, led by bank, 
telecom and energy shares. In economic news, French business 
confidence rose to 90.0 in December, higher than the 89.5 
estimate per Bloomberg and November's 89.0 reading. On the 
corporate front, Nestle SA (NSRGY,52,f1) paid $641 million to 
General Mills (GIS,52,f2) in a joint venture giving it the 
rights to Haagen-Dazs in the U.S. and Canada. Oil-related issues 
also did well as companies like Royal Dutch Petroleum NV 
(RD,49,f2) rose on expectations that OPEC will announce its 1.5 
million barrel per day production cut on Friday. The euro is 
trading higher versus the U.S. dollar.

Asian markets finished higher as the Nikkei 225 index advanced 
2.6% with technology and export issues leading the way. In 
economic news, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 
reported that Japanese industrial production declined a 
seasonally adjusted 1.8% in November to the lowest level in 14 
years. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reiterated plans to cut 
spending and force banks to write of bad debt, saying, ""... we 
must press on with employment measures and structural reforms."" 
Following the positive retail news in the U.S. yesterday, 
exporters fared well with companies like Sony Corp. (SNE,44) 
advancing. The yen fell versus the U.S. dollar given the weak 
economic data.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:51 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was up a point (3 points above fair value) while 
the Nasdaq 100 index was 1 point higher (5 points above fair 
value). The March DJIA futures contract was down 7 points (25 
points above fair value), and the February crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were down $0.68 at $20.59/barrel.

In the spirit of the holiday season, SDG&E has come over from the dark side and now supports the assignability of direct access contracts!  The utility also supports the ability of existing direct access customers to indefinitely remain on direct access after their contracts expire with one ESP, permitting them either to renew with their existing supplier or sign a new contract with another ESP.  In the attached filing, the utility argues that this is reasonable and fair to direct access customers, particularly in view of the Enron bankruptcy.  This will be an excellent development to reference in the comments that are due on January 4th in the DA suspension proceeding.
 
Happy Holidays to each of you and your families!

MARKETS HOLD MARGINAL GAINS

U.S. equities are higher midday amid a lack of substantial 
market-moving equity or economic news. Chip stocks like Advanced 
Micro Devices (AMD,16.34,f2) are helping to pace the advancers 
while the economic slate is empty today. U.S. Treasuries and 
European markets are higher.

As of 11:48 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 
0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite Index is 0.8% higher. The S&P 
500 Index is up 0.5%. Semiconductor and utility shares are 
pacing the advancers while oil and construction issues are 
leading the decliners.

Semiconductor issues are higher as a Merrill Lynch analyst 
raised 4Q earnings estimates for Advanced Micro Devices to a 
loss of $0.15 per share from a loss of $0.23 per share, citing 
better-than-expected demand for the Athlon processor. Atmel 
(ATML,7.35,f1) is also trading higher after an AG Edwards 
analyst raised his rating on the stock from buy to strong buy.

Shares of TMP Worldwide (TMPW,44,f1) are higher after the 
provider of the popular Monster.com web site reported that it 
would not increase its bid for competitor HotJobs.com 
(HOTJ,10.36,f1), saying it had offered ""full and fair value"" for 
the entity. On Monday, HotJobs said that it would accept 
Yahoo!'s (YHOO,17.75,f1) $436 million competing offer if TMP did 
not increase its proposal, which has shrunk since June given 
declines in the company's stock.

Apple Computer (AAPL,22,f1) is up slightly following news that 
it expects to incur a fiscal 2002 loss at its retail stores, 
contrary to previous forecasts, citing the slowdown in the U.S. 
economy and PC market, exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. In 
an SEC filing, the California-based computer maker also stated 
it plans capital expenditures for 2002 of $200 million.

Following yesterday's positive Internet-related news, Amazon.com 
(AMZN,10.96,f1) is benefiting from a report that customers at 
its web sites ordered 37.9 million items during the holiday 
season as of Dec. 21, including over 10 million orders at sites 
outside the U.S.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasury prices are higher toward the long-end ahead of the 
record $23 billion 2-year note auction. Friday's economic plate 
is full as initial jobless claims, originally scheduled for 
release this morning, will be released tomorrow. In addition, 
consumer confidence figures, the Chicago Purchasing Managers' 
Index, new and existing home sales, and durable goods orders 
will be reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are higher with the Bloomberg European 500 
index up 1.3% as of 11:48 a.m. EST, led by manufacturing and 
auto shares. In economic news, French business confidence rose 
to 90.0 in December, higher than the 89.5 estimate per Bloomberg 
and November's 89.0 reading. On the corporate front, Nestle SA 
(NSRGY,52,f1) paid $641 million to General Mills (GIS,52,f2) in 
a joint venture giving it the rights to Haagen-Dazs in the U.S. 
and Canada. The euro is trading higher versus the U.S. dollar. 
Despite overnight gains in European oil-related issues, crude is 
trading lower in the U.S. ahead of tomorrow's expected 1.5 
million barrel per day production cut by OPEC.

by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Worst of dot-bombing is over

The rate at which Internet-related companies are shutting down 
or declaring bankruptcy is slowing, and the worst is over, 
according to Tim Miller, founder of Webmergers.com.

During 2001, he said, 537 Net companies collapsed, more than 
twice the number that met that fate in 2000. ""Shutdowns followed 
on the heels of the stock-market downturn as venture investors, 
watching their exit opportunities dissolve, abruptly shut their 
doors on cash-hungry startups,"" Miller said. He said that the 
slowdown is not due to the fact there are so few dot-coms left. 
Webmergers.com estimates between 7,000 and 10,000 Internet 
companies received some sort of funding. ""At most, then, 10% 
have shut down,"" he said. ""It may be safer to say that the 
Darwinian process has left many fewer weak Internet companies.""

FCC clears Internet for flight

Boeing said it has received approval to offer broadband Internet 
and video service aboard airliners. The service, Connexion by 
Boeing, will make available high-speed Internet and intranet 
access, television and email over the United States. ""This 
license signals a new era for in-flight [entertainment],"" said 
Scott Carson, president of Connexion. ""Air travelers will have 
access comparable to the speeds and quality of service they 
expect on the ground."" Boeing said the service is available now 
aboard some executive aircraft and that Lufthansa may install a 
prototype on one plane within a year.

""Harry Potter"" books and related products were sold, while 
150,000 copies of the ""Shrek"" video and DVD were sold. Amazon 
said 99% of orders were shipped on time to meet holiday

FUTURES POINT TO HIGHER OPEN

U.S. equity index futures are pointing to a higher open as 
economic data is bountiful this morning and equity news is very 
sparse. Initial jobless claims and November durable goods orders 
came in slightly better than expected. U.S. Treasuries are lower 
and world markets are higher.

Cable television operator Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC,47,f2) 
said it plans to eliminate 600 positions, or 4% of its work 
force, in order to reign in costs amid a renewed strategic 
outlook. Cablevision said it will take a $55 million 4Q charge 
for the cuts, which will encompass reductions in corporate and 
administrative functions in different business units.

Allegheny Energy (AYE,36.39) reported that it anticipates 
lower-than-expected earnings for 2001 and 2002, citing milder 
weather and softer electricity sales. The utility stated it now 
expects to earn $3.60-$3.70 per share for 2001 and 2002, lower 
than First Call's $3.90 per share and $4.15 per share consensus, 
respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

U.S. Treasury prices are lower across the curve following the 
release of this morning's economic data. Initial jobless claims 
for the week ended Dec. 22 increased by 7,000 to 392,000. 
Analysts were expecting an increase to 400,000 according to Dow 
Jones Newswires. The four-week moving average of claims fell to 
413,250 from 438,500 while continuing claims for the week ended 
Dec. 15 rose 23,000 to 3,700,000.

Durable goods orders for November declined 4.8%, slightly less 
than the 5.0% decrease expected per Dow Jones Newswires. October 
durable goods orders were revised lower to a 12.5% increase from 
the 12.7% rise previously reported. Durable goods orders 
excluding defense increased 2.7% while orders excluding 
transportation rose 1.1%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European markets are higher with the Bloomberg European 500 
index up 1% as of 8:50 a.m. EST, led by telecom and machinery 
shares. In economic news, French unemployment rose to 9% in 
November, matching estimates but coming in at the highest level 
in a year. The euro-zone M3 money supply grew at an 8% rate in 
November, potentially reducing chances for European Central Bank 
interest-rate cuts. On the corporate front, HSBC Plc 
(HBCYF,11.5), one of Europe's largest banks, announced it 
intends to purchase an 8% stake in the Bank of Shanghai, marking 
the first time a foreign commercial bank will own part of a 
mainland Chinese bank. The euro is trading slightly lower versus 
the U.S. dollar. Crude oil is higher after OPEC officially 
agreed to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels per day at its 
meeting in Cairo.

Asian markets finished higher as the Nikkei 225 index advanced 
0.8%, with brokerage and communication issues leading the way. 
In economic news, Japanese unemployment rose to 5.5% in 
November, the highest level in almost 50 years according to 
Bloomberg. Adding to the negative outlook, Japan's chief cabinet 
secretary said, ""It's very unfortunate that unemployment will 
rise as the government presses on with its structural reforms, 
but it can't be avoided."" According to the Nihon Keizai 
newspaper, Sony Corp. (SNE,44) is in discussions with Fujitsu 
Ltd. (FJTSY,37) regarding the acquisition of Japan's largest 
Internet service provider, Nifty Corp. The yen rose versus the 
U.S. dollar amid hints from government officials that using 
public funds to help fledgling banks is ""one option.""

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:50 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was up 4 points (5 points above fair value) while 
the Nasdaq 100 index was 15 points higher (16 points above fair 
value). The March DJIA futures contract was up 32 points (37 
points above fair value), and the February crude oil futures 
traded on the NYMEX were up $0.30 at $21.20/barrel.

MARKETS MIXED AMID POSITIVE DATA

U.S. equities are mixed midday, off morning highs, amid a 
plethora of economic data and very limited equity news. Consumer 
confidence, new home sales and initial jobless claims came in 
higher than expected. U.S. Treasuries are lower and European 
markets are higher.

As of 11:49 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 
0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index is 0.4% higher. The S&P 
500 Index is up 0.1%. Biotech, airline and energy shares are 
pacing the advancers while consumer products and transportation 
issues are leading the decliners.

Shares of Allegheny Energy (AYE,35) are lower following news 
that it anticipates earnings of $3.60-$3.70 per share in 2001 
and flat 2002 profits, lower than the First Call consensus of 
$3.90 per share and $4.15 per share, respectively.

Chip equipment provider Nanometrics Inc. (NANO,21,f1) is down 
after saying it sees 4Q sales falling 25% from 3Q levels, worse 
than its previous flat 4Q forecast, as a result of the slowing 
economy and excess inventories among its customers.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasury prices are lower at the long-end following the 
release of this morning's stronger-than-expected economic data. 
In positive economic news, the Conference Board's index of 
consumer confidence rose to 93.7 in December, much better than 
Bloomberg's 83.0 estimate and November's revised 84.9 reading. 
The present situation index, which evaluates current economic 
conditions, increased to 96.9 from 96.2 while the 
forward-looking future expectations index jumped noticeably from 
77.3 in November to 91.5 in December. Overall, the report 
reflects a significant boost in consumer optimism regarding the 
U.S. economy.

The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, a precursor to the 
National Association of Purchasing Management index to be 
released Monday, rose to 41.4 in December, well below the 45.0 
estimate per Bloomberg but higher than November's 41.1 reading. 
The index indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing 
sector at a slightly slower rate than in November. The new 
orders index rose to 43.9 from 41.4 while the inventories 
component fell to 33.8 from 36.3, suggesting inventory depletion 
will eventually lead to new production. The prices paid 
sub-index rose to 46.8 from November's 40.1.

In a sign of continued resiliency in the housing markets, new 
home sales for November rose 6.4% to 934,000, better than the 
880,000 level expected per Dow Jones Newswires. The supply of 
new homes fell to 4.0 months from October's 4.3 months. November 
existing home sales increased 0.6% to a 5.21 million unit annual 
rate, slightly higher than the 5.16 million unit rate analysts 
were expecting per Bloomberg.

Initial jobless claims for the week ended Dec. 22 increased by 
7,000 to 392,000. Analysts were expecting an increase to 400,000 
according to Dow Jones Newswires. The four-week moving average 
of claims fell to 413,250 from 438,500 while continuing claims 
for the week ended Dec. 15 rose 23,000 to 3,700,000.

Durable goods orders for November declined 4.8%, slightly less 
than the 5.0% decrease expected per Dow Jones Newswires. October 
durable goods orders were revised lower to a 12.5% increase from 
the 12.7% rise previously reported. Excluding a 69.8% drop in 
defense orders following October's joint strike fighter 
contract, durable goods orders increased 2.7%. Orders excluding 
transportation rose 1.1% as aircraft and aircraft parts orders 
fell 57.9%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are higher with the Bloomberg European 500 
index up 1.3% as of 11:49 a.m. EST, led by technology-related 
shares. In economic news, French unemployment rose to 9% in 
November, the highest level in a year. The euro-zone M3 money 
supply grew at an 8% rate in November, potentially reducing 
chances for European Central Bank interest-rate cuts. Marking 
the first time a foreign commercial bank will own part of a 
mainland Chinese bank, European lender HSBC Plc (HBCYF,11.5) 
announced it intends to purchase an 8% stake in the Bank of 
Shanghai. The euro is trading slightly lower versus the U.S. 
dollar. Crude oil is higher on news that OPEC officially agreed 
to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels per day starting Jan. 1.

Confusion stamps postal ecommerce

Managers charged with expanding the U.S. Postal Service's 
ecommerce activities aren't delivering, a new congressional 
study says.

A report by the General Accounting Office faults the USPS for 
""difficulty defining, identifying and classifying its 
Internet-related initiatives."" Financial information about the 
efforts is also not ""complete, accurate and consistent."" The 
Postal Service has been studying how to implement electronic 
bill paying, online confirmation of deliveries and postal 
product sales. However, the GAO found ""fragmentation, 
inconsistency and poor performance."" The deputy postmaster 
general responded saying he would take action to address the 
problems, the GAO said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yahoo media chief to leave

The vice president of Yahoo's media and leisure division will 
leave the company in February. David Graves, who lives in 
Massachusetts, said he had tired of the travel to headquarters 
in Sunnyvale, Calif. Graves' departure occurs as Yahoo 
reorganizes its business divisions and cuts back on activities, 
including multimedia production. Yahoo said it plans to look for 
a successor for Graves.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Yahoo jobs deal worries CareerBuilder

The online job listing service owned by Knight Ridder Inc. and 
the Tribune Co. is wondering what happens now that Yahoo has a 
deal to acquire HotJobs.com. CareerBuilder has a contract with 
Yahoo, making it the sole provider of job ads on Yahoo Careers, 
according to the Washington Post. ""It's an exclusive contract 
and we expect them to honor (it),"" said spokesman Barry 
Lawrence. Analysts suggested Yahoo is likely to try to buy its 
way out of the deal. ""I am sure anything is negotiable for a 
price,"" Jeff Fieler, a consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns 
& Co., told the Post.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Eshopping season posts 36% rise

Ecommerce during the holiday season was worth a record $6.6 
billion, according to comparison-shopping Web site Bizrate.com. 
The total is 31% greater than Bizrate forecast, and is 36% 
greater than last year's online sales. ""BizRate.com expects the 
momentum to continue into the New Year as consumers take 
advantage of the post-holiday clearance sales,"" the company 
added. The average online shopper's spending also increase, from 
$112.13 last year to $126.77 this year.

Results:
1st Place - Prentice (Congratulations; first time in first place this
season)
2nd Place - Sheas (In the money, three out of the last four weeks)
3rd Place - Mickey (The only player to pick Cincinnati--but 13 points?)
4th Place - WAM (Cleveland Rules)

We had the second-lowest weekly total, 1521 points.   And even though you
would think that when you get to the next-to-last game of the season
everyone should have gotten better at picking winners,  it only goes to show
that the old cliche holds true--on any given day any team can beat any other
team in the NFL.  I think this was an exciting week with lots of close
games--ending on practically the last play of  the game-- and upsets.  What
will your strategy be, this last weekend of games?

1st and 2nd will be hard to unseat - but 3rd and 4th are open for lots of
players.

Big move by the Sheas, from 10th to 6th place for the season.

PLEASE MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The Chili Bowl will be January 27 - more details
to follow.




Remember that the 3rd part of our pool is the separate pool for the
playoffs - AND YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY A PART OF IT - NO MORE MONEY NEEDS TO
BE SENT IN.  Below are the rules for that pool.   Please call with any
questions.

PLAYOFF POOL

Everyone is automatically entered in the Playoff Pool - there is NO EXTRA
FEE REQUIRED.  However, it is a separate contest from the Weekly Pool.  The
rules will be similar to the Weekly Pool, but the whole playoff series will
be treated as one week.  You will decide how many points to give each
potential game winner, and since there are eleven games you have from 1-11
points available for the entire playoffs - but you cannot use the same
number more than once.  Each week you turn in your picks for the teams
playing that particular week.  That means you have only one number left for
the Super Bowl.  Please note in the schedule of Payouts below that there is
a payout of $50.00 for last place.  This could make it interesting for
someone who hasn't done too well and helps to keep them in the Pool.
However, if you do not turn in picks for a week, you will be disqualified
from competing further in the PLAYOFF POOL.


Playoff Pool--1st Place			$130.00
Playoff Pool--2nd Place			$ 90.00
Playoff Pool--3rd Place			$ 70.00
Playoff Pool--Last Place			$ 50.00	$ 340.00

FUTURES POINT TO SLIGHTLY LOWER OPEN

Equity index futures were trading slightly higher, but below 
fair value, as most international stock exchanges were closed 
ahead of New Year's Day. Shares of ImClone Systems 
(IMCL,55.25,f1) fell on concerns over its new colon cancer 
treatment and Treasuries were virtually flat.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 6.0% or 650 points 
year-to-date and the Nasdaq Composite Index is down 19.6% or 483 
points. The S&P 500 Index has shed 12.1% or 159 points. Look for 
volume and liquidity to dry up this afternoon as traders get a 
head start on the New Year's Day holiday.

Shares of ImClone Systems are getting shredded in premarket 
trading after the company said on Friday that the release of its 
colon cancer treatment, Erbitux, would be delayed until at least 
3Q02. ImClone had planned to release the treatment in May 2002, 
but the release will be delayed because the FDA has questions 
about the drug's clinical data.

America West Holdings (AWA,2.47), parent of America West 
Airlines, became the first airline to receive a loan guarantee 
from the U.S. government. America West received a $380 million 
guarantee in exchange for options on one-third of the company 
stock and a commitment to control labor costs.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Lucent Technologies 
(LU,6.18,f2) did not give bonuses to any of its top executives 
in 2001. Lucent said it withheld bonuses because its performance 
""fell short of our objectives in fiscal 2001,"" as the telecom 
industry suffered through massive layoffs and sluggish demand.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds are trading near unchanged in the absences of any economic 
data. The Bond Market Association has recommended a 2:00 p.m. 
EST close for the U.S. Treasury market.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

Most European bourses were closed today with the notable 
exception of the United Kingdom. The Bloomberg European 500 
index closed Friday down 15.1% for the year. The FTSE 100 index 
finished an abbreviated session down 0.5% with weakness in 
financial and oil-related shares and strength in technology 
stocks. Financial shares with exposure to Argentina fell 
following the resignation of Interim President Adolfo Rodriguez 
Saa. The euro was little changed versus the dollar as 12 
countries prepare for the introduction of euro cash at midnight 
tonight.

Japanese markets were also closed with the Nikkei 225 index 
finishing the year down 23.5% on Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng 
index fell 0.3% today. The yen was little changed versus the 
dollar.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:35 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 Index was up 2 points (1 point below fair value) while 
the Nasdaq 100 Index was unchanged (3 points below fair value). 
The March DJIA futures contract was up 17 points (6 points below 
fair value), and the February crude oil futures traded on the 
NYMEX were up $0.30 at $21.20/barrel.

STOCKS SLIGHTLY HIGHER TO KICK OFF NEW YEAR

Against the backdrop of little corporate or economic news, 
stocks are poised to open slightly higher, with technology 
leading the way following an upbeat Semiconductor Industry 
Association report. Chipmaker Micron Technology (MU,31,f2) is 
higher in premarket activity following news that a potential 
partner raised DRAM prices by 30%. Treasuries are slightly 
lower, while global markets are mixed as today marks the 
official transition to the euro currency in the euro-region.

Chipmakers could get a boost this morning after the 
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported that global 
sales of semiconductors rose 1.6% in November to $10.6 billion, 
the second consecutive monthly increase after October's sales 
rose 2.5% to $10.44 billion. SIA also indicated the industry is 
on pace to realize 4.7% growth in 4Q sequential sales. 
Continuing the improving theme, shares of Micron Technology are 
higher in the premarket session after South Korea's Hynix 
Semiconductor (HXSCF,0.80) raised the price of its memory chips 
by 30%, its third increase in a month. Separately, Hynix 
indicated this morning that it will wrap up merger talks with 
Micron this month.

Media conglomerate Walt Disney Co. (DIS,21,f2) was granted a 
temporary restraining order prohibiting satellite-TV operator 
EchoStar Communications (DISH,27,f1) from dropping the Dow 
component's ABC Family channel from its listings. EchoStar 
claims Disney's purchase of ABC Family from News Corp. (NWS,32) 
in October voided the network's contract.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds are lower across the curve in front of today's Institute 
for Supply Management's manufacturing index, scheduled for a 
10:00 a.m. EST release. Formerly known as the National 
Association of Purchasing Management survey, the ISM 
manufacturing index is expected to rise to 46.0 in December from 
November's 44.5, according to a Dow Jones Newswires survey, 
indicating contraction at a decelerating pace in the sector.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European bourses are lower amid a report that the euro-zone 
manufacturing PMI rose to 44.1 in December from November's 43.6, 
reflecting continued contraction in the sector at a slightly 
slower pace. The Bloomberg European 500 index was down 1.2% as 
of 8:52 a.m. EST, paced by declines in telecom equipment and 
energy stocks. Banking stocks, including Spanish outfit 
Santander Bancorp (SBP,19.41), were also lower after Argentina's 
new president indicated that he would remove the Argentinean 
peso's peg to the U.S. dollar, raising devaluation concerns. The 
euro is higher against the dollar following a smooth, official 
transition to the new currency in the euro-region.

Asian stocks were generally higher, led by semiconductor stocks 
following Hynix Semiconductor's 30% increase in the price of its 
DRAM chips. Japan's Nikkei 225 index remains closed for a 
national holiday, while the yen is trading slightly lower 
against the dollar.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:52 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 index was unchanged while the Nasdaq 100 index was 9 
points higher (10 points above fair value). The March DJIA 
futures contract was up 49 points (1 point below fair value), 
and the February crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX were up 
$0.20 at $20.04/barrel.

STOCKS SUFFER NEW YEAR'S HANGOVER

Despite a better-than-expected Manufacturing Institute of Supply 
Management's (ISM) Report on Business, which reflected improving 
conditions in the manufacturing sector, stocks are trending 
lower at midday. Online stocks, including EBay Inc. 
(EBAY,65,f1&f4) and AOL Time Warner (AOL,31,f2), are lower 
following analyst downgrades while chip stocks are advancing on 
the heels of an upbeat Semiconductor Industry Association 
report. Memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology (MU,33,f2) is 
higher following news that a DRAM rival raised prices by 30%. 
Treasuries are lower following the ISM data and European bourses 
are lower late in the day.

As of 11:52 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 
0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite Index is lower 0.3% and the S&P 500 
Index is down 0.5%. Energy-related stocks are among the worst 
performers while computer storage, networking, and semiconductor 
shares are leading the advancers.

Chip stocks are higher following a Semiconductor Industry 
Association (SIA) report that global sales of semiconductors 
rose 1.6% in November to $10.6 billion on the heels of October's 
2.5% increase to $10.44 billion. SIA also indicated the industry 
is on pace to realize 4.7% growth in 4Q sequential sales. Shares 
of Micron Technology are higher after South Korea's Hynix 
Semiconductor (HXSCF,0.80) raised the price of its memory chips 
by 30%, its third increase in a month after two previous 20% 
increases in December, suggesting an improving pricing 
environment for memory chip makers.

Shares of Schering-Plough Corp. (SGP,35,f2) and Merck & Co. 
(MRK,58,f2) are lower after the drug manufacturers reported that 
their combined allergy drug didn't prove as effective as hoped 
in late-stage clinical trials. The drug, which borrows from the 
chemical make-up of both Schering's Claritin and Merck's 
Singulair products, ""did not demonstrate a statistically 
significant improvement in the treatment of seasonal allergic 
rhinitis compared to each product administered separately.""

Shares of AOL Time Warner are lower after analysts lowered their 
revenue and earnings forecasts due to continued advertising 
doldrums, even as the Internet and media giant reported that 
member retail online purchases rose 67% to over $33 billion in 
2001 from the prior year.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

Bonds are under pressure following this morning's release of the 
Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index, which 
rose to 48.2 in December from November's 44.5, better than 46.0 
forecast per Dow Jones Newswires. A reading below 50 reflects 
contraction in the sector while a reading above 42.7 generally 
indicates expansion in the overall economy, according to ISM. 
The new orders index rose to 54.9 from November's 48.8 and the 
employment index rose to 40.5 from 35.7. The prices component 
rose to 34.7 from 31.6. While still reflecting contraction, this 
latest ISM manufacturing index suggests an improving outlook for 
the manufacturing sector, rising for two consecutive months.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets continue to trade lower late in the session 
despite the euro-zone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index's 
rise to 44.1 in December from November's 43.6, reflecting 
decelerating contraction in the sector. The Bloomberg European 
500 index was down 1.5% as of 11:52 a.m. EST, paced by declines 
in energy stocks. Chip shares were higher, led by Infineon 
Technologies (IFX,22) following the Hynix Semiconductor news, 
suggesting that the sector may be stabilizing. The euro is 
higher against the dollar as concerns about a rough transition 
to the new currency in the euro-region abated.

Internet Daily 
for Wednesday, January 2, 2002
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Women are majority of eshoppers

An estimated 29 million Internet users bought gifts online 
during the holiday shopping season, and 58% of them were women, 
according to a nationwide study by the Pew Internet & American 
Life Project.

""It's a vote of confidence for the online environment,"" said Lee 
Rainie, the project's director. ""It means women think of the 
Internet in a much more serious way."" Last year, online shoppers 
were even split between men and women. For women, a major 
attraction of online shopping is its time-saving efficiency, 
Rainie said.

AOL Time Warner's AOL found a  trend among its shoppers. 
""Overall, females accounted for 64% of all shopping, 
underscoring the extent to which AOL's shopping audience is 
paralleling offline retailing and making online buying a habit,"" 
the company said in a release. AOL added its members spent $33 
billion online during 2001, an increase of 67% from the prior 
year's levels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Online job sites frustrate

There's a whole lot of lookin' going on, but not much hiring. 
That's the complaint of many users of online job sites, such as 
Hotjobs.com and Monster.com, according to The Wall Street 
Journal, which cites the experience of a 37-year-old Indiana 
woman as a representative example. Grace Dubois spends five 
hours a day searching through job boards. She has applied for 
nearly 400 positions in the health-care industry; seven have 
resulted in job interviews.

Her experience is supported by research, the newspaper reported. 
Outplacement consultants Drake Beam Morin said Internet job 
resources account for only 6% of management-level job hiring. 
CareerXroads, a consulting company that publishes an annual 
guide to job boards, found corporate Web sites are the most 
effective resources for job seekers.

The biggest complaint from users of CareerJournal, the job site 
operated by the Journal, is there are not enough listings. There 
are about 23,000 jobs posted, down from 35,000 a year ago. Any 
failure to follow up with applicants is the fault of employers, 
not employment sites, Dimitri Boylan, president of Hotjobs.com 
-- soon to be acquired by Yahoo -- told The Journal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
AOL blocks Harvard acceptance emails

America Online cannot explain why it blocked delivery of about 
100 emails to applicants from Harvard University's admissions 
office. Harvard said it used email to notify almost 6,000 
students who applied for early admission, the Associated Press 
reported. While between 75 and 100 messages were bounced back to 
Harvard, most of the applicants telephoned the admissions office 
to get their answer.

The Dean's Office has decided to cancel several of the Spring 2002 electives. This decision was based not only on the very low pre-enrollment in the four canceled courses but also on the low overall ""occupancy rate"" for all elective courses (still only 46% after the cancellation of the four courses). This low ""occupancy rate"" was due to the EWMBA having a surprisingly large number of students who graduated in their 5th semester.  Approximately 85 students completed their MBA requirements in December 2001. 

The following are the four courses that were cancelled:

E233   Investments, Prof. Shachat
E278-3 Business Law, Prof. Ross
E296-7 Behavioral Finance, Prof. Odean
    (If your work schedules permits, you will be given enrollment priority to the day section.)
BA/E 278-1 Law& Strategy of e-Commerce, Prof. Tiller


Obviously we regret this development, and recognize that this may create a schedule problem for you.  Therefore, we'd like to propose the following two registration options:

Open Classes
If you would like to add an elective that did not fill up during the pre-registration process, reply to TJ tj@haas.berkeley.edu <mailto:tj@haas.berkeley.edu>  ASAP, but no later than noon on Friday, January 18th.  We will add the course to your schedule. This will ensure that you get priority over the other students who will participate in the ADD/DROP phase starting on January 22nd. Please refer to the attached file to see which classes still open.  

Closed Classes 
If you would like to get in to an elective which is currently full, and your original bid for the cancelled course would have been sufficient to get in to the now-full course, we will add you to the course as an over enrollment. Reply to TJ tj@haas.berkeley.edu <mailto:tj@haas.berkeley.edu> ASAP, but no later than 12 noon on Friday, January 18th. Please refer to the attachment file to see which classes are closed.       

Please Note:  
Per campus rules, in extraordinary circumstances such as these we are allowed to over-enroll, but by no more than 10% of the official class size.  Thus we have a finite number of spaces to work with.  Please refer to the size column of the first attached file to see how many seats we have to work with. If more of you want in a class than we can accommodate, we will use original bids as the tie-breaker.

Once again, please accept our apologies for the inconvenience. Should you have any questions, feel free to call the office 510/642-1406.
